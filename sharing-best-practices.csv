preaching on social media is a decent idea. Taking a break from beautiful photos to remind people of ethics is a good idea.
Timely social media post as the weather gets nicer
Social media. Reshare the Access Fund gorrila movies
Social media shaming. Beat up litter bugs. 
Social media since new climbers likely aren't as involved in oac websitw/newsletters or community events
social media, youtube videos
fbook
Fb reminders about best practices
On gym facebook pages
FaceBook!

Facebook is really good
Blast in on social media, create posts that promote discussions
Instagram
Instagram, Facebook, Vero, Twitter, newsletter, events
I’m not overly familiar with OAC social media accounts but images of climbing areas with snippets of this info in the caption could be helpful as well.
Get out more LNT stuff on fb. LNT Has all kinds of digital stuff I bet they'd let you share for free.
Post fun facts on social media about environmental info and etiquette every week, even if they seem obvious.
Amp up social media postings toward the beginning of the climbing season.
Seek advice from younger members on social media presence. After last year's failed meme campaign the OAC was left seeming out of touch and out of date.
I think some of the Facebook memes last summer sent the message pretty clearly ;)

# Crags (N=29)
## Crag signs (N=21)
bulletin boards at crag entrances
emphasize Leave No Trace and make free garbage bags available for climbers to pack out their trash and other waste they find
Trailhead booths.
Signage a climbing areas.
At crags where it makes sense, could have an info plaque in the parking lot?
Posters at the crags.
Posting signage at the crags.
Put up signs at the crags? Not sure how helpful that would be.
Poster boards
Information at crags
Better signage at crags/trail heads. I've seen crags outside of Canada that have poop/garbage bag dispensers. That kind of thing really makes you think about your impact. Even if I you don't bother to read it, the visual reminder is obvious.
Billboards and [...] are best tools. It is nice to hear it in-person if possible somewhere (gyms or at the crag in summer, or even at MEC or atmosphere stores).
Signage at parking locations.
Signage at some crag parking lots.

Signs at climbing areas.
Climber specific poster at a crag reminding people how to ve good stewards. Leave your radios at home, don't throw rocks, pick up your trash, etc.
Signage at climbing/bouldering areas that encourages climbers to be environmentally responsible and to maintain a positive relationship with land owners/parks/etc.
Reminders at every crag and [...] should cover all climbers.
Fixed signage at crag entrances

## Physical presence at crags (N=8)
Be at the crag and lead by example.
Walk the crags on weekends
at crags with a lot of beginners/close to city
At the crag. Reading a social media post can be forgotten but telling people leaves a greater impact
Rattlesnake Point is always hard for me with the amount of non-climbers present who don't understand safety especially so I'd target there.

# Gyms (total N=33)
[...] and posters.
gyms
gym info sessions
presence at gyms
Update signage available to gyms to promote ethics. Offer sponsorship opportunities on signage to offset costs or ask gyms to cover expenses of printing. Bigger, brighter, more eye-catching.
Presentations at gyms and social nights in regions other than toronto
In the GTAs' indoor gyms
Posters in the gym.
Pass on info at the gym. A lot of gym to crag newbies do not know. More info sessions at gyms for sure
Reaching out directly through climbing gyms perhaps.
workshops at climbing gyms

Instead of having the OAC tabling, having days at gyms where members can actively sign up could see a more engaged turnout.

“Gym to crag” style courses offered at climbing gyms.

## Talks at gyms (N=12)
outreach at gyms
through gyms and info sessions
Maybe seminars at gyms once a year?
Having presentations at gyms would be a great start! I'm also currently living in Ottawa and Vertical Reality one of the climbing gyms there has days where they take members of their gyms outside to learn best practices for outdoor climbing. I think this is great and if more gyms could do this that would be great.
Free presentations at gyms
Gym to crag seminars at Gyms.
Education at gyms - give talks, not just have people at booths.
Have gym visitors that hold seminars on nature and climbing in nature
maybe ask gyms to include basic etiquette in their lead lessons. Make a pamphlet
Could potentially do outreach to gym climbing teams (as they be the next generation of crag climbers)
maybr events at the local gyms - "thinking of climbing outside?" And have a seminar about environmental impact, access concerns and good steward behaviors? It's not enough to send the emails and alerts here and there. People don't read long things, we know this from the "TL;DR" acronym and attitudes of how people generally read things online.  I think people who are new to the outdoors would genuinely have an interest in being more prepared and hearing it from someone knowledgeable rather than their "buddy who went out one time with another buddy and knows what to do and what's going on"
Organize workshops and talks at climbing gyms around the city

# Events (N=7)
Informational class talks
Through live workshops and one-on-one teaching programs.
at events (climbing festivals),
in-person info sessions
LNT workshops and casestudies
More crag clean up days. They are fun, have a good message, plus you get to meet Ontario climbers.
Meet ups for fun days together and cleaning

# In-person (N=5)
Lead by example, have a strong expectations that we keep the area clean
mentorship opportunities
Face to face conversation is very effective I believe
Other climbers need to mentor new climbers on ethics
It is nice to hear it in-person if possible somewhere (gyms or at the crag in summer, or even at MEC or atmosphere stores).

# Other online (N=15)
use [social media] contests as vehicles to get people talking.
Informative videos?
Just more info online
Online
Newsletters
emails
online community
Online forums
Online articles.
Website infographics?
Monthly (ish) email newsletters including useful info and links. Youtube is fine; if Petzl has a great video, link to it.
newsletter.
Email blasts
Email,
... I'm still all for the podcast idea, they're hot right now and you can casually talk about things that are important and how different people interpret different practises etc can also be included with other climbing tips, gear reviews and such that may be more interesting for people to listen to... maybe get a segment on the badbetapodcast if they're into it

## Partners (N=6)
MEC
approach gear shops about training employees in best practices to share with the general climbing public
Where they buy their gear. These staff probably get a lot of questions from newer climbers and have a good platform for planting the seed about the need to be mindful when outdoors.
Advertising with Partners (like MEC/climbing gyms)
Use the Toronto section ACC
Partner with guiding companies, and MEC - get staff there to hand out info to people buying climbing gear? Or have a booth at MEC?

## Guidebook info (N=7)
Mini guidebooks? Hang tags?
Supplying small pocketbooks with info that climbers can keep handy
Put relevant info alongside climbing crag guides
Make topos, and have an intro with all that stuff, especially if you could write it in an engaging story form. I for one and interested in stories of what access funds are up against, and how the perception of the climbing community makes it more difficult to access various areas.
Pages in the guidebook etc.

guidebooks

# Other (N=17)
Word of mouth
Media
Climbing magazines.
Books, word of mouth, policy, etc
public shaming.
Inform climbers the risk/severity of not following the rules.
Just keep doing what you doing but maybe just be more persistent.
Posters at youth competitions, or making lessons on “outdoor etiquette” a mandatory part of the junior competitive coaching circulum?  (educate them young!)
Animal proof waste bins at the most popular crags?
A pamphlet that gets given out to anyone that takes an indoor to crag course.
Consider running workshops educating effective but non-confrontational interventions when non-best-practices are happening.
How it has influenced the opening and closing of areas around ontario and the world.
Encourage more word of mouth and self-enforcement amongst climbing groups.
Definitely valuable to target climbers, but I think moreso I'm concerned with when other people (hikers) come through and don't understand they're breaking safety standards around climbers / don't understand their environmental impact. 
Maybe a an exposé style Reel Rock film?... just kidding. Sort of. 
Information about natural plants and growth in the area.
Would have been good to see some of this content at the Reel Rock festival too.

# N/A
I honestly wish I had a good idea to put here.
