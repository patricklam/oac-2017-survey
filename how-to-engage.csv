How should the OAC engage with the community? [social media, at the crag, at gyms, other ways]

# Gyms (N = 79)

I believe engagement still needs to be extended to new outdoor climbers through the gym. New and even "seasoned" climber are often not aware of LNT and access issues.

Presence at gyms would help the OAC. Maybe even half hour to one hour work shops.
Host info session event open to public, meet-n-greets at the gym, etc.
Posters at indoor gyms or have events at indoor gyms
Meet at gyms
Love your presence at gyms
showing up at gyms
at gyms, at MEC 
Maybe more presence at gyms
Better relationships with the gyms. Have a table setup during comps
Get into the gyms more, have events at gyms.

# Social media (N=74)

digital Media
social media
Social media is also important of course.
social media
Include more opportunities for community input, e.g. monthly/weekly feature question on social media.
Social media is probably the best way to engage members and non members. Need to find way to reach non members??.
More social media presence
Be active on social media,

At the crag would be awesome! Having climbing mixers somewhere or meetups at the crag would be cool too since we're often looking for new outdoor partners
Crag
crag. Run clinics and workshops as OAC fundraisers. Partner w/ gyms for fun/themed events with a social focus, helping climbers meet other climbers. Interacting with more experienced climbers is helpful and encouraging for newer people not sure where to start. Getting involved w/ OAC can be a good way to help ppl get plugged into the local climbing community.

Events
Organize climbing social events
In-person events - ie lectures/slide shows, social outings, events at gyms
More in-person contacts with climbers, somehow.
events or popular venues
Clean ups, events
create events with other groups like the arcteryx in store events- more at mec
More low commitment large group activities around cleaning up oraintaining local crags to increase knowledge and gain short term high volume help could be a useful way to increase visibility and awareness. Ex. The pulling of invasives at rattlesnake.
pub night?
More non climbing events like Reel Rock. Pubs nights in the GTA would be nice.
Events
Running more events (crag clean ups etc..)
Events
Social Events
social events
Events at local gyms would reach many climbers, especially relatively new climbers like myself.
workshop collaboration with stores (arteryx, patagonia, MEC etc).
More formal presentations. Social media tends to be good for simpler communication. Folks need to feel more personally connected to the OAC.
More small events the community can help with to feel like we are doing things, and to help us learn what more we can help do
Through talks as well as get together around the GTA
Events
Social nights at gyms or bars
film fest, gym to crag courses

Online presence is good.
online presence is good, would be interesting to see the OAC at the crag more often

# Misc (N=4)
Need reps from the climbing communities in ontario. thunder bay- sault ste marie- sudbury
Ask for more help from the community.
there is a massive surplus of new outdoor climbers in the toronto area. Too many for the experienced people to teach, its getting a bit out of hand. Days to help make for a  better community, aimed at newer climbers, would be nice

# Other (N=20)
outdoor comp
The guidebooks were long overdue, you could only access spots if you knew the developer or knew one of their friends. Better updates on outdoor grades. Better photos needed.
and printed newsletter
and community outreach
Community outreach programs to inform community of climbing
Collaboratively
You’re doing great
Your examples are more than sufficient

Like it is
I think the OAC engages well with the community.
I think they are engaging well at this time
I think you're doing a good job via social media, gyms, at crags, and your web site
Just keep doing what you're doing
I come from Quebec and so I just don't know much about OAC, hopefully, yet.
Don’t be elitist and snobbish, don’t take sides
information at retail locations?
No gyms.
