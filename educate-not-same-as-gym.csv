What is the best way to educate those who just don’t know that the outdoors is not the same as a climbing gym?

# Gyms
Have every gym display the Gym to Crag poster, potentially point it out whenever they have new members sign up?  That might be overkill though.
Have info about outdoor climbing posted in gyms
Advertising at gyms! Offering workshops!
At the gym, info sessions, pamphlets, etc.  Should also be somewhat responsibility of gym  owners for stewardship
At the gym itself. Through videos as well.
At the gyms through presentations
Be present in the gym.
Clinics and courses at gyms
Communicate to the gyms of maybe adding that info as part of training sessions.
Continue building stronger partnerships with the points of entry to outdoor climbing - gyms, guides, and a general awareness so that people bringing friends have more resources to convey the message.
If they are transitioning from the gym, providing gym-to-outdoor transition courses for free (or free with OAC membership) at gyms in the spring would make sense.
Increase presence in gyms. Increase signage, partner with guide companies to run info seminars and teach skills at gyms.
Talks at climbing gyms about climbing outdoors (FREE)
Gym to Crag information sessions.  At gyms or crags.
gym-to-crag is probably the best, although i don't know much about these programs
Gym to crag programs
go to gyms and do workshops
go to the gyms and have informational sessions
Gym education sessions in the spring with free gear/beer. Sign up members, & educate. Get gyms to sign on to organize and crusty old climbers to complain. Maybe have Mike Penney and Andriy act out a skit.
Gym events
Gym info sessions, crag stewardship programs.
Gyms. Crag stewards.
Workshops at climbing gyms
Gym staff is a good first point of contact. Then need appropriate referral network for new gym climbers looking to get outside to learn the necessary skills in person (ie guiding companies etc)
gym to rock courses, presence at gyms, connecting with lead climbing courses at gyms
gym to crag programs/brochures + presence at gyms
Posters and talks at the gym.
Probably info at indoor gyms. A gym-to-crag course (maybe add this to lead courses).
probably needs to be integrated into those introductory lessons at gym-level
Promote free seminars at gyms
Set up posters in climbing gyms
That’s a tricky problem. I feel like there is a communication barrier that’s developing in the gym, where newer climbers aren’t connecting (either by choice, or because they’re innocently oblivious) with more experienced climbers who know how to behave at the crag. I like that I’m seeing more “gym to crag” type courses available at gyms (especially GTA gyms). That’s a great idea.
To host meetings/lessons at gyms before bringing groups out
gym presentations,
OAC Infographics in gyms can help educate
Promoting education at the gyms more would be good. Like getting gym staff aware of how to recommend to people where to make the transition.
Marketing from gyms
Maybe info nights at climbing gyms? Host a session for people who are thinking about going outdoors this season (before the season opens) and cover some of the outdoor taboos that gym climbers frequently do.
The gym to crag sign is great. Have the gyms put them up in high traffic areas (water fountains, shoe racks, etc) for maximum exposure.
Team up with local climbing gyms and do outreach through there
Most people start there and get most of the information from gyms about outdoor climbing
Information at the gym from the gym about climbing outdoors.  Gyms need to take on the responsibility of educating the people they are releasing into the community.
Offer in-gym workshops and events
Outreach at the gym
Starting at the gym and getting involved with lead climbing instructors so a consistent and logical message is being delivered to new lead climbers

# Events
Best technical practices seminars that also include crag stewardship and behaviour suggestions.
Education days.
Creating events where outdoor climbing is topic of discussion.
At the crag seminars and courses
Classes/discussions at the crags, sometimes they need to be told (firmly?)
Host gym to crag days with seasoned outdoor climbers. Emphasize what makes it so wonderful and make others value the same.
Maybe a fun game at the festival.

# Other
Being new to the sport.  No one taught me proper ethics. I’d recommend a section in gripped this time of year. And social media.
Discourage climbing outdoors as being the first step from transitioning from gym to crag, encourage hiking, and car camping as alternatives to learn how to interact with the outdoors
Drop flyers at crags or rent a chopper with an audio and preach to the crags.

# Courses
Outdoor clinics in the summer with free goodies.
Run classes/workshops on transitioning to the outdoors
Help them find appropriate training. Is there a directory of all the organizations running clinics and offering training? What are their credentials? Are there any industry certifications? How are they regulated? Help them sort the good from the bad, link to events/programs/offerings that OAC approves of.  Promote technique improvement since a lot of people probably wouldn’t be motivated to just learn about safety alone.
Interactive workshops
Intro courses
Intro to outside courses
Outdoor guides
mentions during beginner courses
Set up more information sessions. Run them with local volunteers. 
Provide courses or guided trips
Provide a workshop with a fee on climbing  outdoor safety and etiquette.
Provide reasonably cost days where new people can go learn to climb outside with an experienced climber so they don’t rely on YouTube videos or just winging it.
Start with good habits, don't try and correct a problem once it is too late.
I think that getting people to courses like on the rocks and stuff is the key. 
Train guides and stewards with LNT signage re best practices.
Workshops and courses
Reach them before they go out especially as it starts to get warmer
host events (free ones) at places like MEC, at local gyms. Host free courses on "rock climbing outside 101". Show people the gear, etiquette and explain risks in a non preachy way

# Mentorship
word of mouth
Also, every climber should be a good steward of the sport, be helpful when you see issues
By setting an example.
Mentorship
Mentorship!
mentorship
Mentorship program
mentorship programs, ambassadors at crags, gym to crag information sessions. people arent trying to be shitty they just usually dont know any better
Mentorship programs. "Ask me if you have questions" OAC badges that experienced climbers can carry.
Mentorship? Recommend ACC events aimed at beginners?
equipping experienced outdoor climbers  to approach and educate said climbers
An army of trad dads.
Encourage experienced climbers to be advocates, if they know new climbers that want to get outside, encourage them to invite them out and teach by example best practises.... make helmets cool again!
Climbing mentors
Encourage mentors in the community to spread the word and show pics of climbing leaders in the community doing good things.... maybe a blurb why.
Classes, workshops or mentor finding programs.  Everyone that wants to go outdoors should find a mentor. This sport is about passing on skills. Mentorship needs to be further encouraged. 
Encourage people to seek out climbing mentors, and suggest ways to not be an ass so they acquire said mentors.
Hopefully through friends and other climbers in the community. Encouraging people to educate their fellow climbers at all times!
Encouraging existing climbers to teach others and promote good habits.
Make sure the majority are educated enough to inform the others.
Peer pressure.
There are a lot of us who would be willing to educate the people who don’t “read the sign”.
Social pressure.
I can't imagine... Seeing a park ranger that reminds them of proper behavior?
## More confrontational mentorship
Calling people out for stupid behaviour.
Beat them over the head.
Darwin awards should be given out.
Fellow climbers should tell them to stop if they are doing something wrong.
Constant input. Like dealing with small children,
Keep telling them that
Volunteer climbing rangers who could ask inform offenders, police behaviour and coordinate with authorities of ejection required

# Swag
Have everyone sign a pledge and get a sticker. Stickers will end up on water bottles, helmets, etc., promoting the OAC's message to be good crag stewards and the important points that go along with that.

# Crag presence / signage
crag presence
presence at crags
Presence at the craigs
I think you have to have a physical presence to guarantee you're reaching that population, either at the gym or at the crag.
Send ambassadors to Nemo and RS.
Have representatives at the crag. Some kind of program you gain where you are the environmental reps.
Polite reminders at the crag.
## Signage
Teach then at the earliest possible time- trailhead booths or information boards.
info at trail heads, clinics
More signs at climbing crags.
Draw the comparisons out clearly and educate climbers on site or through boards at the crags.
Posting signage at the crags
Signage at gyms and crags
Signage at gyms for indoor-outdoor differences
Signs in gyms, outdoor areas,
Signage
Signs
I think experience is the best way. Maybe no dumping signs around or on your way to the crag. Although they are pretty clean from climbers.
Repetition, presence of posters and reminders at gyms, entrance to crags, social media, etc.

# Social media
also make use of social media more as an educational tool
Social media campaign
Social media
Social media videos
Social media video with humor?
social media, youtube videos, gym info sessions, presence at crags - events specific to indoor to outdoor transition
## Content
video on website, social media posts - infographics.
I'm not sure. Infographics can go a long way.
Perhaps a video detailing the differences as well as the consequences.
Make funny videos online spreading awareness and have courses. Rakkup should have a local Crag feature on related PSA
Not sure...posters comparing the differences? Venn diagram? That’s a tough one.
Infographics
Maybe youtube videos explaining how climbing outdoors is different than indoors.

# Guidebooks
Climbing guidebooks, post relevant pages from guidebooks (you got my permission! - JD)
Mini guidebooks with rules and etiquette. An intro course?
explain barriers in access, the little blurb in the beginning of guidebooks or on topo...

# Don't
Let them stay in the gym
Promote indoor climbing to those who are too stupid or ignorant to be let outside of the gyms

# Not sure
Too many new climbers are naive to the dangers of outdoor climbing.
Not sure.
Unsure. Humans can suck sometimes...
