How much is the OAC's work worth to you? Are you looking for additional ways to financially support the OAC? (e.g. a preferred membership tier, or via Patreon) Which membership perks might you appreciate?

# Would donate more (N=58)
$15/year
One million dollars! 
worth a lot
i try to support when I can
sure!
Absolutely valuable!!! Not sure a specific pricing scheme, but propose needs to achieve goals and definitely willing to contribute. Like to know the details.
After the threats of losing Lion's Head and other crags throughout Ontario, this has become increasingly important to me. I'll definitely be looking for ways to help.
As a current volunteer, OAC's work is very important to me. I believe in OAC's message and goal, but believe that they are under-staffed and cannot provide the proper time and dedication it deserves. I think setting up a patreon, or a preferred membership tier would definitely help. But also holding event fundraisers, workshops, etc. are other fun ways to raise money (maybe a climbing festival).
Extremely valuable. I'd support a preferred member program or give additional donations if requested. I wouldn't just send money for no reason if I just thought it was gonna sit in your bank account instead of mine. I don't care about perks, but I'm sure others would.
Hard to say. I have been a member for years. Whenever there are fundraising events for specific items ( i.e. Old baldy), I happily contribute.  To be charged annually, I'm not sure. Access in Ontario is fickle and the purchase of land... if that is feasible and a goal with increased funding, then I would not be opposed.
I currently support YouTube channels I like through pateron at $1/month each. I would happily subscribe at a minimum $1/month to an OAC pateron account not expecting any reward.
Based on initiative at hand
I donate. ;)
Absolutely! I would love to volunteer but don't know how!
I don't want more personally out of my membership but I would like to the OAC doing more with my increased donation. Increasing transparency on what members money goes towards, possibly through quarterly spending reports or similar, would increase members' confidence that their money was being used effectively.
I'd probably be willing to donate up to 50 dollars a year, which is similar to what I give to bolting initiatives/the hardware fund. The clickable link on the webpage is good. More publicity regarding donations might be better.
I’d support through paid festivals, comps and clinics
If I could ice climb in Elora, for example, I would be willing to pay $50 like I did to climb in d'Argent in Quebec.
If I wasn't unemployed I would might consider donating more. Maybe a raffle for premium members. I don't mind gambling if it goes to a good cause.
The work the OAC does to maintain/further climbing access is hugely important to me.  I would be interested in furthering my financial support via Patreon.
Worth lots. An option for ongoing donation/auto withdrawal  would be cool
Yes!  That would be great.  Preferred membership would be cool.
If there was a preferred membership tier, I would pay as much as I do for my ACC membership per year. I don't expect you to provide programming, however discounts at food/services around climbing areas or gear shops would be awesome.
I haven’t given it much thought but but I would be happy to pay an annual membership fee to use Ontario crags as long as the money was going back into maintenance of the equipment on the cliffs.
I intend to become a member, as I think the issues OAC is tackling are very important. I would contribute if OAC had a Patreon.
I like the idea of having a preferred membership, but can't think of any specific perks that I would appreciate... Sorry!
I’m happy to toss the OAC money, but not concerned about perks for doing it
Im looking into it.
I'm still a student without a lot of money, but once I have a proper income I will consider supporting the OAC with a regular donation.
I should do Patreon...didn’t know there was one!
I think the OAC should encourage annual (volunteer, perhaps) dues. I have, on more than one occasion, joined the Access Fund, and don't have much of an issue with dues.
No patreon, tiered memebership would be oky
OAC is very important. I would definitely donate more.
Patreon would be great. 
Patreon
Patreon and kickstarter are novel ways for working toward small contributions for big goals imo
Patreon sounds very convenient. Not sure about a tiered membership system, I feel like climbing communities tend to have a pretty egalitarian approach? Maybe some kind perk related to crag car parking? (Not sure if that’s possible given the variety of land ownership scenarios)
Priceless. I like the $5 lifetime membership fee. I would be happy to donate that annually, or even monthly.
Premium membership
Preferred membership tier
preferred membership tier via Patreon << would really be interested in this initiative
Sure.
The OAC does great work in land use and keeping accessibility between land owners and crag climbers.  A small annual fee wouldn't hurt the bank for people
The OAC's work is critical! I would be open to paying an annual membership fee if it helped support additional initiatives. 
I would pay an annual membership fee as opposed to a one time thing like now
I would provide additional support, provided I had a good understanding of where the funding was to be used.
I would support most fund raisers.
lots. will be organizing a more substantial donation this year. do not want to see differentiation between how members are treated depending on their donation levels, other than sponsorship/promotional aspects for corporate donors.
With the helping accesss I would financially support with a membership but that's my extent.
OAC is essential. 
very important to me. this group is our best voice for access which is constantly being threatened.
very much!
Would donate more for worthwhile and CLEARLY COMMUNICATED cause
Work oac does is extremely important. And I don’t value enough importance.  
I would gladly donate what I can. But I have not done so yet.
Its worth it. You guys do a good job.
It's worth more than I currently give but how much more is hard to say.  I do believe that everyone that climbs in Ontario should support the OAC.
It’s worth quite a bit. I would be more inclined to support financially if I could also be more involved physically.

# General positive sentiment (N=13)
Happy with my membership (annual corporate).
I am interested in a membership
I appreciate OAC's work a lot! 
A lot
Access is a huge issue in Ontario. Educating on gym to crag is essential to prevent accidents, messes and access issues. 
Access is extremely valuable to me, climbing is my life, however, minimizing environmental impact and sustainability are far more important. I would like to know that our climbing impact is sustainable, and would rather no one climbed on the escarpment if it is not.
Access is my main focus
we are corporate sponsor. get members from across Ontario.
Putting up routes/ replacing old gear outside is wonderful.  Parking lots around Beaver Valley crags NEED to expand.  Between climbers and GTA hikers swelling in every weekend.  Every single lot becomes overflow and roadside parking becomes the norm.  DG doesn't even have a lot, the city of singhampton just steams over a pile of cars on the side of the road instead, as do the local land owners.
Perks are not necessary for me. Continued and hopefully enhanced climbing access is sufficient.
Their work is worth a lot. I don’t really care about perks or additional financial support
the OAC is invaluable. I personally don't donate for any particular perks, but appreciate the negotiations on crag access
OAC does valuable work in ensuring crags are accessible. I am interested in becoming a member and participating in events

# Supportive but...  (N=9)
Cannot put a number of it as I don't really know how to but principally having access is infinitely valuable.
3) doesn't matter, really.
3 not sure
I appreciate it but until I live somewhere I can climb more often I don’t think I can really put a big worth.
I don't know
If I knew what you did for climbers I would pay. So far I see you make lots of money from running events like the beaver valley fest but where do you spend it?
I don't like Patreon (not a fan of monthly, I would rather pay a lump sum). 
I don't need an "perks".
I would feel more inclined to financially support the oac if they were working on access of areas closer to where I live (muskoka)

# Leaning no (N=8)
I'm unable to financially support at this time.
I think tiered memberships are stupid - people give in all different ways and not everyone can give financially. I think that financial and in-kind (e.g., time/volunteering/helping) memberships should be equal. Finances are a barrier for younger climbers, but younger climbers are the ones to whom OAC should be doing the most outreach. Facilitating their participation by offering them alternative routes to membership would help grow the OAC, the community, and the number of climbers who are aware of and supporting the issues.
No. As it stands, the OAC does not seem to do enough to merit a monthly donation from me. Either I'm not hearing about all the hard work, or there's not much being done. My membership fees are enough.
No, I am not looking to support the OAC financially in any other way other than the membership which I have purchased.
They have expressed a very limited mandate.  Why do they need more funding?
No
It's unclear of the value provided. Old baldy was a big win, but there has been  nothing since then. Still lots of access restrictions in Ontario. Very limited access in provincial parks. I haven't heard of any movement on access issues. I would be willing to support specific projects. Ie purchase a crag, insurance subsidy to open access, fascilitate trail building, car parking....
I would be more interested in one-time donations rather than recurring monthly/annual donations. I think it's important to have a clear cause so that I know what my contribution is supporting. I donated to the Old Baldy initiative because it was clear what the money was being used for. General donations are a little unclear, is the donation going to land purchases, fixed gear, building of parking lots? People are more interested in donating if there is a clear objective.

I don't know much about what they do.  I think they provide insurance for some festivals.  Other than that, I think they held negotiate access.  Hard to put a price.
The oac should seek alternative funding avenues. Merch, events, grants
What perks are there? Unaware
Volunteer
I've never thought of this and can't answer it.

# Perks
I don't know that member perks would help. Unless you can get conservation discounts. That might help the member base and increase general awareness of the OAC.
A t-shirt or tank top promoting the OAC and ontario climbing would be great.   Or discounts from OAC supporters - business.
Perks could be posters, free calendar, deals on parking passes for crags, deals/discounts for businesses located near crags (e.g. kimberely general store, ravenna general store, Wundeba (near mt nemo)), free gear?, climbing magazine subscriptions.
I don’t need perks. Just updates. And continued volunteer requests. As plans and commitments change.
Unsure. Possibly? Perks like discounts at mec or climbing related courses would be cool.
Very important that we keep access to outdoor climbing in Ontario. To be honest I can't think of additional membership perks.
Would be willing to donate for a specific cause, i.e., kickstarter for a pit toilet, camp sites, trail making, etc.
Would definitely support in other ways of available. Simple t-shirts, stickers etc are enough
OAC is very important to me.  If there were membership perks, it could be for more stickers.
Membership perks.......swag? I.e. t-shirt, ball cap, buff, stickers, etc. Maybe even cards I could hand out to people? Like, ones that have the "10 ways to get a crag closed" list from Gus's guidebook.
Selling Tees and stickers is always great.
If you made t-shirts again I would buy one.
Make some sweet merch and mark it up :)
some sort of camping discount would be great.
Acc cabin discounts also. Guide book discounts, etc
A mug would be nice.
An event to acknowledge members for their contribution would be nice. It seems that many climbers do not know if fellow climbers are also members, or what some of their significant contributions are to the community.
climbing guides. crag information and directions. scrambling areas. Multi-pitch climbing area info. 
Discounts to festivals or discounts on guiding would make me donate more
Membership perks like prodeals would be great 
Free day pass to a gym?
From what I understand the OAC does good work which I appreciate. However, being a climber, I don't have a lot of extra money so I think membership perks would have to be pretty good (like free parking at crags all season).
Gear
Gym discounts during the winter
Hmmmm, I'd potentially be interested in perks. Discounts on gear?
Insurance for climbing, discounts through industry reps.
Perks might be discount on annual Halton Membership?
I think a cool membership perk would be a mentorship program, where new climbers can learn to rap safely, set up a top rope, clean etc in a casual environment... Also a great way to show new climbers proper crag etiquette and tell them its cool to wear a helmet
I purchased the southern Ontario climbing routes book. I know that it’s only OAC approved and not actually published by OAC, but it’s a good example of something I find worthwhile enough to contribute to. An interesting membership perk could be the opportunity to participate in gear swaps, free trials at local gyms, or discounted access to training clinics.
I think giving a donation, or charging for events, merch would be good
I think that more crowd funding could be done for retrobolting mt nemo and other crags. Things like gofundme and kickstarter would be a good place to draw that Gumby cashflow.
Perks -- maybe discounts on guidebooks, climbing technique books, $5 off a cam?
Retail discounts or group insurance plans would be awesome, much like is available with the Access Fund in the States.  They charge an annual membership fee to get this going... a $5/lifetime membership is pretty cheap!  Even if we moved to $5/year that would be affordable, and maybe MEC or Arcteryx would allow membership discounts?
- Swag
I would LOVE if the OAC handled all permit purchases & waivers for various climbing areas (example, my Glen permit & waiver) in one place. However, I know that's a huge project to take on. Though, it would encourage more people to become OAC members.
An MEC discount would be a helpful OAC membership perk.
I would like to see more climbing areas solidified. Not just "tolerated" (ie, devils glen). Even if it requires an OAC membership or something to access those areas.

# Other / specific projects
Much more information on what to climb, when, where and how but covering a WIDER area and not just the usual areas
would be interested in other opportunities to support OAC. contributing to specific project/fund drives would be of interest (eg supporting classes in gyms; bolt fund). would also be interested in getting more involved in promoting education and doing advocacy.
Membership is important to help the work the OAC is doing. I would financially support without doubt any campaign oriented to secure a crag acess or to get back access from a closed one. In a membership we dont know were our money is going
i would appreciate getting our access issues resolved
It would be nice to if a portion of park fees could be directed to OAC. In other locations, an info board with donation box or something (I'm thinking of places in RRG)
I shouldn’t be seeing climbers making bonfires in Crags located in sensitive areas.
It is invaluable
work is important
I'm actually not sure what this question is asking. I think the existence of OAC in paramount to the rock climbing community. Your serves are highly valued. I hope that answered the question...
I feel the OAC's mission to be very important to me, especially if the access issues associated with rockwood could be remedied.
