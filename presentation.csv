Would you come to a climbing-related presentation organized by the OAC? Who would you recommend as a speaker? What type of speaker (sport climber, big wall, access hero, etc) would be most interesting to you? How important is it that you've heard of the speaker?

Yes
Yes. Most of them
Yes if it was in my area.
Yes, idk, any climbers, not important to have heard of the speaker.
yes. don't know any speakers
Yes, I'd love to see what others say here.
I would love to attend a presentation by the OAC. Speaker is less important to me.
I would definitely go to a presentation. No recommendations I can think of. Any type really. Not important. Fairly new to the climbing community.
I would definitely come.
I would come
I would attend speaker events on a climbing-related topic, as long as the speaker is experienced in their field.
I probably wouldn't attend as it would make the most sense to hold the presentation in Toronto and I find getting there difficult.  An access hero would get my attention though...

# Maybe
Maybe, never been interested before but if something were to catch my eye.
Maybe - if a convenient time and location (a webcast would be great for inclusion). 

# No
Currently in BC...  so unlikely to attend this year.
Unknown
Unlikely
Probably not. I'm not in Toronto and that seems to be where all the attention is.
Probably not, they tend to be far away from me
Not likely, tends these things are far away
No I would not attend. I am not a fan of going to lectures, would rather be doing other activities.

# Other
NA
NA
That's 4 questions in one lol
There are too many questions in this question to answer.
Wow. There's many questions in one here. H
They are so poorly advertised they are full by the time I hear about them.
Perhaps some climbing related movie screenings?
Not unless there were other groups involved or a cool film or something.
Depends on what was being presented.
Depends on the time and topic, but yes would be interested (MEC is a great location or Climber’s rock)

# Where?
if it was near home
If it was within reasonable distance and time for me. I live in a smaller city where rock climbing is not as big we have to travel for everything.
Depends where it is held
Yes, if it were at an accessible place in KW
Yes, I would attend a lecture in Toronto.
Yes, I would attend if available or location depending. Having a wide range of locations would be best -- Toronto, GTA West, GTA East, KW-area, Niagara Peninsula area, Barrie, Sudbury
I would come if there was a presentation nearby (Guelph, KW, Milton)
I would love to if its in kitchener! I would pay for it too.
Access is key - if it's deep in the heart of downtown TO, I won't be coming.
I would come if it were local. I don't think the speaker would have to be overly famous unless you were charging admission.

# Importance of knowing the speaker (no=13, lean yes=8, yes=7)
not at all [that have heard of speaker] (I'm also not overly familiar with even the biggest names in climbing so I would assume that it's more than likely I haven't heard of them)
not important [that have heard of speaker]
Not important to know them
Yes I would. No speakers to recommend. It wouldn’t matter how well they are known, as long as the conversation is relevant!
Yes, dont have to have heard of the speaker
Yes. Any guest speaker who is inspirational! Doesn't matter if they're "famous".
Yes, and knowing the speaker is not important.
Yes, Don't really care on speaker or topic.
I think they are lots of Climber’s that are with a great deal of knowledge that I may have or have not heard of that would be worth coming out to see.
It depends on what it is about and who is presenting. It's not important that I've heard of them, as long as they have something interest to say.
Yes! Not too important that I have heard of them, but if I haven't heard of them that may be telling. I think whoever chooses could use their judgement
Yes. And it doesn't matter whether I've heard of the speaker. 
Absolutely, I would be interested to hear the speaker. It's not very important that I've heard of her/him.
Possibly. Knowing the speaker might increase odds. Date, location, all withstanding
Depends on the circumstances. Not sure who I'd be interested to hear, but name recognition would certainly contribute to my interest.
I would be more likely to come to a talk by someone I've heard of.
yes i would attend, if there was a big name speaker attached to the event I would be more likely to attend.
To get a large number of people out to a presentation I feel you would have to have a name that most people would recognize.
Knowledge of the speaker is somewhat important for me.
Big name will draw in people, but most importantly they need to be an engaging speaker.
Yes. Big names will obviously draw bigger crowds. Maybe combine a big name to draw a crowd and entertain, with a second speaker to cover access issues!
I think a known name would attract more climbers. Good ads and would help if less known.
I would come. I'm not exactly proud to say it, but yes celebrity matters. At least to get people in the door. I love being surprised by something or someone I don't know of. Though I do need an anchor to bring the initial excitement.
Important that I've heard of the speaker. 
Priority to someone I've heard of.
I’d need it to be someone I know to bother.
Yes. Important that I'd heard of them
Very important.
It definitely helps if I've heard of the speaker. 
I might if the speaker were well known, otherwise probably not. A sport climber would interest me most.

# Content
climbing ethics
- overcoming falls
yes. any type of speaker - even a discussion/presentation of how other areas (quebec, europe) have generated an organized top down and publically supported climbing scene including trail building and funding for bolting/crag development.
Yes - any type of climbing enthusiast who has a sustainable mindset
With more climbers we need people to get educated on respect, safety, and etiquette. Maybe an OAC “crag certification” course. Membership harness hang tags?
I would certainly try to come. Anyone who can incorporate bast crag practices in their talk would be beneficial, I think. Having heard of them would be a draw.
I would come to any climbing related presentations organized by the OAC. Doesn't have to be a specific climber/speaker - would just love to hear more from the OAC and their goals/mission. Organizing events/presentations would definitely help the OAC be heard more, as well as help new climbers with etiquette (especially now that climbing is exploding around the world).
## Technical
If there were events in London where I live I would be interested in going. I would be interested in demonstrations for different safety techniques. I wouldn’t be interested in just hearing someone’s storey.
Yes this would be interesting to me. Someone who talks about safety and crag etiquette would be important to me.
Yes would be interested in talks, perhaps focusing around outdoor climbing and proper safety. What things to know before moving from indoor to outdoor climbing (checking to ensure permanent gear/anchors are safe to use etc..)
Yes. Technique based talks and classes preferred. Don't really follow personalities or athletes
Yes. My gym doesn’t offer a huge amount of classes on technique and training so I would be interested in things like that. Might check out a sport climber but would be best if they were paired with other speakers or some kind of event or workshop after. I wouldn’t be likely to make the time just to come hear one person speak.
- Safety for outdoor climbing (see Some bad habits outdoors)

# Who?
I'd prefer to see a wide range of experiences in the speaker, so all of the ones suggested (big wall, sport, etc.)
Yes I would love to come to a presentation. Different speakers from a different disciplines would interest me to broaden my horizons beyond what I know.
Yes I would. I think speakers with lots of experience climbing outdoors would be most interesting. I don't need to know them, just that they have experience and knowledge to share.
Sure... Personally I would want a land owner giving a talk about why a crag should remain closed.
yes, I'd attend. sport/big wall climber, access leader, trainers would be interesting. not important that I've heard of them, but their experience would be important.
Yes. I’d be most interested to hear a speaker related to environmental conservation activism and/or access hero
Adventure expedition and travel would be interesting themes.
Would love to attend climbing presentations/slideshows from the stars of our sport
Yes. Anyone. Sport, big wall, access hero. Doesn’t matter if I’ve heard of them.
Yes. Long term climbers and owners of gyms, climbers with inspiring stories in the community... Not important if I've heard of the speaker. Would just be very interesting!
Yes!  A good speaker would be someone who is well known and an outdoor climber.  There isn't much big wall climbing in Ontario, so an access hero or sport climber would be great.  Canadian would be awesome.
Famous sport and big wall climbers. Famouns Alpinists eg: 
Someone who not only inspires great feats of strength or dedication in climbing, but also in making it sustainable and continually accessible to all for years to come.
I would. Someone about sport, do we even have big walls in ontario? O.o
I would go. It would be nice if the speaker was someone noteworthy. Big wall or alpine would be interesting. Something with big objectives that people would find inspiring.
If the talk were in a location that's accessible to me then sure. I'm not sure who I'd like to hear from in particular. I would love to hear stories of adventures, climbing big walls, or pushing ones limits in sport climbing etc. The speaker isn't as important as what they have to say.
I would attend. Good speakers would be those who are known in climbing. 
## Access (N=11)
Demonstrate how we compare and can achieve status like other high grade groups such as in rrg
Sport climber, access hero, volunteers with OAC
Sport climber & access hero.
Access heros are a good idea too! And general spread of access and ethics information
I would like to learn more about the history of climbing, the mental state of climbing, climbers pushing their limits, breaking barriers, paraclimbing.
History and the process of land disputes and negotiations with access issues
I would go. The speaker needs to somehow help promote the OAC's goals rather than their personal "accomplishments."
I would go if it were about reopening closed crags
I would come.  Anyone who truly represents preserving climbing and nature
I think that the OAC membership would most benefit from having someone come in who has worked hard to provide and maintain access to climbing areas, but to get the draw, they'll need to be a well known climber. The majority of our climbing population are sport climbers, so someone who does sport as at least part of their climbing practice would be ideal. I believe that having someone come in who'll draw numbers but who's able to talk about access and why it's important and how access is acquired and maintained would do a lot to educate our membership on what is actually happening behind the scenes and how much work this really is. They might even pick up their shit tickets and chip bags more often....
I would be most interested in hearing from champions of access in other areas.
## Hard climber (N=8)
I would go. An accomplished climber would draw a bigger audience.
either a big wall climber or a prolific sport climber/boulderer
Yes. Rock climbing grade crushing adventure superstars. 
Yes. Sport and Olympic athlete program
Yes, sport climber and somewhat important but I’m learning about different climbers regularly so open to new names!
Yes. Sport climber or crag developer
Any top sport climber
Yes!!!! I'd like to see sport climber and big wall climber. There have been too kangaroos by ACMG guides. 
## Local (N=19)
I would suggest people you frequently see volunteering at events.
I'd come if I can get to the location (no car of my own). Tommy Caldwell could be great. But people involved in the Southern Ontario climbing community might also be interesting.
If it was convenient to my schedule. local champs like Gus, Randy, Nathan and Rebecca, Leslie, etc. I feel a solid mix of sport specific people and general adventure climbers would be the best option, as I personally find there are three camps in Ontario, exclusive indoor/boulderers, sport climbers, and people who also climb trad.
I would actually. Bring local climbers / setters / people in the industries
I would attend. A great speaker would be the people bolting new lines, finding new crags, building trails, and maintaining access. Also conservation authorities, so the community can hear their perspective.
Of course. Have an event that represents climbing in Ontario. presetnation from the main people developing the rock and ice areas in ontario
Someone who has set routes at local crags, trad climbers, world travellers
Speaker isn't super important to me. An OAC presentation in itself has value and appeal. Obviously larger events with an "hero" would have larger draw, but need to be combined with local relevance/OAC presentation. 
Yes I would attend. Someone from ontario who has branched off to other destinations
personally, I would like to hear from people who climb in areas that aren't typically known for climbing. Ontario being one of them. It always great to hear from experienced climbers who do hardcore multipitch in Alberta but it would be nice to have someone relatable. That said, any speaker would be great. 
Would come if it was held close to my city. I'd most like to hear from people who have been influential in the Ontario climbing scene; people who have bolted a lot of routes, put up big first ascents or are dedicated to maintaining our crags. Can be any discipline.
That sounds great. I would think starting with some local Ontario heroes might be a fun way to test the waters and get people more aware and involved.
Yes, and a speaker that is familiar with climbing in Ontario.
Yes, any influencial climbing figure, particularly canadian climbing figures.
Yes   I would if it involved interesting topics.  I would recommend local climbers with experience  and who are knowledgable.   Sonny Trotter perhaps or any other well known Canadian climber.  Anything related to any type of climbing would be interesting.  
Yes. Local speaker combined with international recognized individual to share how they were successful
Yes, barring it is not in the GTA.  Presentations can be given at crags as information sessions.  Experienced trad climbers, to promote safe trad in ontario. (instead of hearing that trad is unsafe in ontario and should never be done)  <<actually was told this by a leader of OAC.
Yes, I think having a speaker from Ontario would be a good option! Whether they started climbing here or still do.
Sure, I'd come.  I'd be interested in hearing more from Ontario climbers or climbers from nearish by (Gunks, maybe KY), since this is where we tend to climb. Climber type isn't too important, nor is having heard of the speaker, as long as he or she is good. [And more women, please.]
I would like to hear more about ontario climbing history.
## Other category
National Geographic athlete (adventurer of the year?!)
Noteworthy, the Canadian Adaptive Climbing Society is starting to develop programming in Ontario, could be worth bringing in an adaptive athlete... Jaisa Sulit comes to mind.
Yes. Inviting someone who has endured/survived a dangerous situation at a crag could be informative and interesting.
Yes. A speaker with a different take on climbing than just ticking off a list. 
Yes! Access hero, developers, northern climbers, underdogs
Yes, I would attend an event if it was convenient and in the city where I live. I’d be interested in sport/trad climber’s, expeditiobists, and access ambassadors.
Yes. I think someone who could speak about access would be beneficial - challenges, successes, what gets climbing banned, what gets climbing instituted...Not necessary to have heard of the speaker. But someone who has a proven track record. And it would be nice to have it put online so you don't necessarily have to make it to the talk in person.
Definitely access hero, some sport climber and/or big wall.
Yes. Big wall and access would be interesting and I wouldn't have to need to have heard of the speaker before as long as they have lots of experience
Yes. I like people who are pushing boundries and find big wall climbers and people who explore new areas the most intriguing.
Yes, I would like to listen to a big wall climber. I don’t care if the speaker is not well known.
yes, sounds fun. Both access and expedition climber would be great
Yes I would. Don't know who but would be interested in a big wall speaker.

## Female (N=9)
For sure! Would love to see women speakers, climbing activists and pros
Would like inspirarional women.
Yes! Female climbers!
[And more women, please.]
Yes, some sort of outdoor adventurer, not necessarily a climber, female voice
Female speaker would be a nice change of pace.
would prefer if it was a climber who could give stories of projects in Ontario. Would also prefer some diversity in the speakers.
Jen Olson or Brette Harrington. Well rounded female climbers.
Leslie Timms
## Names
I would love to listen to some climbers. Will Stanhope, Sonnie Trotter and Brette Harrignton come to mind. Local legends like Leslie Timms and Joe Skopec would be good to give a platform as well.
Local speakers to consider. Gus&Justin. Mark Smith. Leslie Timms. Park Naturalists/Ecologists. Peter Hoang. Nate Kutcher. One of the young guns like Lucas Uchida talking about comp climbing could draw the up-and-coming OAC members.
Jany
Yes I would come if is nearby. I would like to hear more from trainers like Eric Horst rather than professional rock climbers. I would only come if I know the speaker.
Maybe Randy [Kielbasiewicz]?
Pete Hoang
Steve Bechtel
Someone known in community. Ie leslie timms... Mark smith...
Yes.  Danylo [Darewych] comes to mind
Absolutely. Ideal speakers: Jonathan Siegrist (visited lions head), Joe kinder, members of the Canadian climbing teams. 
Conrad Anker
Honnold, conrad ancher, will gadd,
http://www.hansjoerg-auer.at/ (He has a speaking section on the website)
Yes. Justin dwyer, Jany M. 
Think outside the box as well. Presentations can be in the form of guided hikes -- Bruce Trail geology hike for instance. Justin is willing to give guided hikes too.
Yes, I would come to a climbing-related presentation organize by the OAC. I would recommend Daniel Martian, Tony Berlier, Yasser El-Sheikh as potential speakers. I would like to hear about how their motivation for climbing has evolved, how they deal with success/failure/injuries, and  if/how climbing has allowed them to grow in other aspects of their lives. A sport/big wall/ice climber would be interesting to me. It's not important that I've heard of the speaker.
Yes, I would attend if within my area. I think a good variety of speakers would be interesting. Both known (Sasha DiGiulian is part Canadian and often in Toronto visiting family) and amateur speakers would be interesting.
