How could we better involve the climbing community in our relationship with land managers?

# Membership drives / fundraising
39 yes of climbing in Ontario, I haven't seen I don't see anything new. Except to increase OAC membership.
Ask for donations to buy land. Give members a stake in that land etc..
Climber donations?
Donation boxes? Pay for toilets like at the swamp? Post signs to take home all garbage?
I'm not sure. Other than pay for access where it's required, be a good steward.
Strive for more volunteers so more voices are heard
Providing grants to complete work may be successful ... assuming money isn’t an issue!

# Letter writing campaigns
ask us to write letters or petition - i was very happy with how the OAC led the engagement with the Niagara Escarpment Commission last season and the successful outcome of that engagement. many people would pitch in and write/petition, we just need to be asked so our efforts can be focused.
Climbers need to be aware of the importance of the OACs relationships with land managers and informed as to how they can engage and why their advocacy is important. I would imagine OAC submitted comments the environmental registry when the Niagara escarpment plan was being reviewed- were OAC members encouraged to do the same and was a comment template provided?
Picket lines, rallies by the hundreds at landowners doors to allow more routing.  
Perhaps to encourage climber’s in Ontario to write said land managers directly.
Organize meetings and letter signings - like was done with Lion's Head.
More info, ask for feedback or solicit climber feedback to be assembled into a report for land managers (yes, that would be a lot of work.) I don't think flooding land managers with emails from climbers is going to work (TL;DR), but I don't have any personal experience with this.

# Communicate w/landowners
But really, inform landowners of OAC programs that educate climbers on safe practices, environmental responsibility, respect.  etc.  It may help lean them towards opening their property up if they know those coming will treat it as their own.
Ask for areas where climbing would be good but is hindered for whatever reason and try to mitigated the problem if possible.
Let land manager meet leading climbers in their crags to get to know what they are all about.
Invite land manager to climbing events. Use every opportunity to get them more involved

# Communicate w/climbers
Just becoming aware of this issue has made me a better climber, from a perspective of involvement with land management. Having a mindset of good relationship between ourselves and land management affects our behaviour in a positive way. Climbers ought to be ambassadors for our sport. I've been able to make comments about beneficial activity I've observed by other climbers to, specifically, Halton parks staff. I've also had parks staff observe me packing out trash that I've gathered during my climbing session. These behaviours, I believe, affect our relationship with land managers at a grass-roots level. 
Climbers need to be educated to leave no trace and not to be self-centered (like parking issues that we cause for example).
I would like more information of the barriers.
I'm not sure, would need to better understand the challenges and opportunities here -- but would be interested in engaging further. part of the challenge is probably that people like me aren't aware about these relationships.
Signage
Teach them how to behave when confronted
Talk more about what you’re doing and why so people understand access issues. If they understand access issues they will be less likely to blow it for everyone.
Transparency on what is happening
One additional meeting per year for a general membership (streamed live as well for those who cant attend) giving status update on projects, with video/minutes/slides presented on website for perusal by those who could not attend.
Outreach to climbers using the crag - potentially by having OAC outreach at these crags. Dual effect: help educate climbers and gather information.
We are more powerful in numbers.
Webpage / publish updates about any current relationship issues.
Write more/new articles about it. Keep us informed.
We want to hear from you more. This is the first I've heard of this.
To answer your question, were more climbers aware of the efforts invested by the OAC into enhancing the relationship with land managers, I believe that would help create the mindset of involvement in said relationship.
Talk to us! The whole Old Baldy thing was a good example of poor communication by the OAC to its members
Tell us what you are doing
I think most climbers have no idea who owns/ manages the land we climb on. Encouraging that in places like guidebooks might be a good start.
Inform climbers, information is key
Taking in opinions from the community when issues with the land managers come up.
Have special patrols to inform climbers in the summer time
Engage volunteership.
Bring them pie.
Share more knowledge
Publish results of engagement sessions.
Have an online forum or something like that so climbers can report info to other climbers or land managers.
Poll climbers for where they want efforts focused
Have larger OAC crag presence.
Iterate the importance of climbing in pairs or very small groups of up to 3 or 4, as weññ adjunto the importance of being imperiously polite and cooperative while on someone else's property.
I don't feel like I know much about your relationships with land managers. Climber education on this might be worthwhile.
Keep us up to date about what you're working in.
Keep us up to date on ongoing conversations/issues.
More information on what is causing access issues and what we can do to help.
Public announcements of partnership details would let the public know just how much work the OAC is doing
more transparency
More stewardship programs.
Education.and engagement at OAC events. Online dialogue even
I know when crags are threatened climbers act quickly and en masse - maybe making it clear to climbers that their individual behaviour has the potential to impact the access of everyone?
More education
Post or make it known what land owners require of Climber’s  who visit there property. Ignorance is not bliss. 
## Ownership
Provide info on best practices. Educate climbers on who owns what land, and what is important to that party.
## Gym
Maybe have more info at gyms.
Educate, more materials at gyms, info
## Live stream
Live stream meetings! Live stream everything, get people aware of the hard work that you guys do
## Social media
Newsletters or updates on website
Post regular updates on social media. Keep these short and easy to understand.
More FB info and adds
Keep us informed about communications and issues via social media, e-newsletters, etc. Tell us what we can do to help
Raising more awareness to the OAC's cause, and keeping the climbing community updated with what the OAC is up to. Better social media presence could help with this
Continue with social media engagement. More posts.

# Events
Crag clean up days.
Organize crag clean ups etc.
Crag clean ups
Cleanup events and such
crag cleanups, presence at crags to promote good climbing etiquette
Land clean up initiatives
Have a round table, bring the land managers and climbers together to talk.
More stewardship days? I would also argue that there are some climbers we don't necessarily want more involved.
Meeting each other in person. Land owners and climbers coming together. Social event? Or a meeting. Or at earth day...
Organize town hall style events where the community can interact directly with representatives from these land managers.
Host forums so climbers can add their input with the OAC
Outreach meetings / events centered on being in conversation with each other
socials
I'm not sure. Social events?
Have joint events

# Humanize land managers/climbers
Showcase champions of various activities and highlight what people are already doing. Awareness is usually lacking.
Do bios of the land managers for each cliff. When people see who the managers are, they may be more inclined to behave themselves. Maybe signage at a cliff to say who owns it?
Show off your respectable members, not just the regular everyday folk
Maybe appreciation emails or things of that nature.
Have a land manager "spotlight" on the OAC website
Climbing advocates to discuss with land managers. Volunteer to take land managers out for a day to see the activities. Allow feedback both ways.

# Modern route development
Safety is paramount. Obviously accidents happen. However, inexperienced people taking run out lead falls on chossy crags is bad news. Promoting safety and perhaps a more liberal bolting ethic could be a good idea to prevent accidents at crags.

# Other
Look at the FQME. they do a great job of this at Val david and other crags.
Have a presence at craigs other than the glen, half way, and rattlesnake. There has been boling at closed areas i.e. campden and nemo and although there is benifit to the community it also put the areas at rick as the activoty should not be going on

# Thanks
i have no idea about this but access is a big paart of climbing and I am thankful you guys deal with this
