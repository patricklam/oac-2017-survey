Besides Halfway Log Dump, what do you think about maintaining a presence at other crags? Which ones would you target? How would you run such a program?

Summary:

First, the question of where. Nemo was most popular at 39, followed by Rattlesnake (24), Beaver Valley (21), Lion's Head (17), and Niagara Glen (12).

How is a harder question to summarize. We received a wide range of suggestions there, but it boils down to: parking lot/trailhead, walkabouts, and signs. Reps could be identifiable by nametags or shirts.

Many times, the comments stated that it was critical to have someone friendly, helpful, and non-judgmental representing the OAC.
Suggested incentives for crag stewards included free parking passes or special clothing comped by retailers/manufacturers or pro-deals.
Organizing a group of stewards could permit each steward to get some climbing in during the day.

At the parking lot, we could have a pop-up tent, coffee for climbers, info packets, route/conditions beta, good crag etiquette, a theme of the day.

It could also be useful to have crag stewards walk around and chat with climbers (and non-climbers). There could also be sessions with park rangers.

One idea was to activate the membership at large to be crag ambassadors, perhaps by having a training session.

Clinics could help, for instance on best practices, both in terms of climbing and leave-no-trace. Alternately, cleanup events came up a few times. One could imagine a once-per-month schedule for crag cleanups.

We are constantly working on initiatives for better signage.

# How:
I think having a volunteer out a few times a month with a table setup in the parking lot or at the start of the trail may help.
Volunteers with identifying shirts/vests/nametags could just walk around and talk to climbers
crag stewardship: weekend stewards to help transition gym climbers.
Talks with Conservation Halton might be beneficial to offer parking passes in exchange for crag stewardship.
Having people in OAC shirts that are friendly, helpful, and non-judgemental would be great.
someone around to gently chat with climbers, talk about ethics, etc. It has to be done in such a way that people don't feel spoken down to and become defensive.
OAC presence to help those new to the sport (safety, environmental, etc.)
Perhaps coffee for climbers?
Have someone at the Lower Parking Lot with a booth, or get someone to hand out info packets to people out climbing.
Maybe something similar to cycle Toronto and their pop up tent, bike lock up at events etc....
some signs about garbage might help at the base of the cliff (RSP), but for the most part climbers are respectful. I think its more so things falling out of packs, pockets etc... 
I think a volunteer in front with some information is useful, maybe even paired with some park ranger or environmental group to show of some local species of plants, bugs, snakes... Etc...
Maybe having a table a booth at the parking lot during busy summer weekends
tables at the entrace on popular early season weekends, run a crag clinic, Best Practices seminar for people early in the season ('how to switchout the rope at the anchors' 'why rapping isn't necessary'). Promote a cleanup day at Nemo. Promote a program to involve the Cons Areas to improve base trail conditions/improvements.
could use someone around to gently chat with climbers, talk about ethics, etc. It has to be done in such a way that people don't feel spoken down to and become defensive.
target Rattlesnake and Mt Nemo. They are a high traffic area and accessible for first time outdoor climbers, as well as hikers. Both could use education on safety and conservation, and proper anchor techniques.
I would recommend litter pickup days...
Somewhat hard to at other crags like Devils Glen or Swamp because no real place top at up a tent or table unless in the parking lot.
Negotiating installing signage at trailheads with ethics info, parking beta, etc. Organization stewards on weekends at other high traffic areas like DG. Work with industry sponsors to offer perks to volunteers for their commitment. Ex, steward jackets comped by an apparel company, access to prodeal discounts etc.
informing new climbers, possibly setting up a permit to climb at threated crags in which you have to pass a course or ethics standard to gain a permit before climbing and top roping of rap rings!
I believe the advertising of this on social media for the stewardship program is an excellent way to run the program and I would continue with this.
It would be good to have climbing ambassadors at crags to help inform people of appropriate etiquette. This could be run using OAC volunteers - sign up to be an ambassador for the day and get a tim's gift card, or maybe schedule a carload of ambassadors and then rotate shifts throughout the day so the volunteers could get some climbs in when they arent ambassador-ing.
Besides educating climbers, other people may benefit from simply seeing info on climbing.
Posters at local climbing gyms is nice. List of things to do and not do.
Hard question...  No one wants someone on them about leave no trace. But I’m tired of picking up garbage that other people leave behind.
Having a presence at the crags would be awesome, especially if it was providing some sort of service (route beta, safety conditions for the day, education). I think it would work best if there were some things you could just ask about all the time and then maybe a set talk / theme for the day that changed every weekend.
Ideally the OAC would have a place where climbers can check in on their way to a crag and get information on current issues, find partners, pitch a tent (with fee), have a toilet, etc.  Such as the University of Toronto's outdoor clubhouse at Metcalfe.  (IN A PERFECT WORLD)
I think a presence helps remind people that we are all part of the same community, but doesn’t have to be a continuous presence to accomplish that.
I think it is a good idea. Stewards would help in keeping things in order and raising awareness especially with Leave No Trace
I think it's a great idea, especially with the explosion of gyms (and potential corresponding increase in outdoor climbers). Target the most-used crags, if possible, focusing on climber stewardship / good crag etiquette (aka let's keep the authorities happy so they don't close the crags on us).
I think signage is more efficient than physical presence.  But let’s get signs at all crags.
It's nice having someone like MikeS at Nemo (no clue if that is actually OAC related though). Really, I think the best presence at most crags is to have folks who are already climbing there involved, educated, and willing to speak up. Climbers/OAC organizing environmental initiatives is great in terms of how we are viewed by non-climbing bodies. Things like garlic-mustard pull etc.
I would target the most popular/largest crags on weekends.. especially those without washroom/garbage facilities. Enforcing proper clean-up/noise management/discouraging groups/educating on waste disposal, would go a long way.
maybe an info board at trail head for crags
Maybe on long weekends, have a rep at the trailhead talking about safety, access, and environmental impacts?
Member-at-large program at the crag, we should be encouraging all members to be more vocal. Go talk to others at the crag about the OAC. Member-at-large "training" session.
Might be nice, but seems like the organizational effor might not be worth it? Not sure how to motivate volunteers ... free camping like at Halway Log Dump isn't really an option.
On busy weekends have someone at the front of crags providing handouts on leave no trace and/or climbing behaviour and ethics.
Organized volunteer cleanup days with information and climbing in the afternoon at any of the popular crags near the cities where people leave trash. Maybe haul in vacuums into bottleglass to suck up the glass for instance?
Plus utilise the installed billboards to post flashy notes.
Reminders to stay on developed trails
Volunteer crag hosts - job is to run at least 1 clean up per year. Easy volunteer experience for young folks resumes
Volunteer table in the parking lot (this creates the most visibility)
Leave no trace signs. I saw this in bc and think its a great reminder to climbers and hikers.
We don't necessarily have to run ongoing programs with constant presence, but perhaps annual clean ups at each crag would be a great way to get people caring after the land.  These are also social opportunities and great ways to connect with other climbers who care about the same places you do.  Maybe one clean up per month, always at a different location?
Garbage is a constant problem at [the Glen] - So garbage pick up would be a good place to start. Providing some reading material/flyers for the Niagara Conservation to give out at front desk would also be a good idea!
graffiti clean-ups, etc. volunteer-based with supportive outreach through OAC.
A ambassador for the OAC could do a walk through on random weekends during the season to provide information re: best use practices and answer any questions.
In terms of running the program, I think it would be good to do it through events. Coordinate an event through Facebook, use the opportunity to inform ppl. Could pair a social climb or basic clinic with some kind of clean up or stewardship activity. Entice ppl with snacks as well. Partnering with local conservation authorities and citizen environment groups could be helpful here to get ideas for how climbers can engage in stewardship activities to support the areas they like to climb in. Getting climbers to go above and beyond in this way would help to strengthen the optics around climbing and build partnerships, I.e. other engaged groups who may advocate for climbing access in future.
I would target higher traffic crags by setting up booths that provide info and a reminder of what the OAC is doing.

# Halton (Rattlesnake 24, Nemo 39)
All of Halton Region climbing areas
A presence would be helpful. Rattlesnake Point would be a good target since it's typically full of new climbers many of whom are ignorant of ethics. Nemo is not as bad but full of new leaders.
Bottle glass? It’s most people’s first access.
don't need to see more people at crags, but would go with RSP
GTA crags would benefit from some sort of crag stewardship, weekend stewards to help transition gym climbers.
Halton area crags (Mt. Nemo, Rattlesnake) are quite busy with new climbers from the GTA. 
I agree with the presence at crags. I think the most popular ones for newbies (e.g., Nemo) would be most helpful.
Yes, do it! Mt Nemo is an example of a crag that has somewhat fallen to the crowds the past few years
Yes it would be wise to do this at almost all crags.
Yes, Nemo
Yes, start at the popular crags like Rattlesnake and Nemo.
I fully believe in leaving no trace. Other than some chalk on the rocks. Right now it would be rattlesnake point and not sure how I would run it.
I have never been to halfway log dump so I don't know exactly how this works, but if it is effective to get climbers to respect the areas and behave appropriately I think it could be a great thing at Nemo and Rattlesnake
Popular locations, such as Rattlesnake could use some kind of presence.
Rattlesnake is such a busy crag - would be good to see some presence there.
Rattlesnake!! Nemo!! Not sure how to run
Rattlesnake Point and Mt. Nemo have got significantly busier and could use OAC presence to help those new to the sport (safety, environmental, etc.)
Rattlesnake Point is the obvious area.
rattlesnake point or [...] would be my suggestions as they are perceived by me to be the most frequented by novice climbers.  I don't have the knowledge or skill set to make recommendations. 
Rattlesnake
I think Nemo would be a good crag to target because it is VERY popular being so close to Toronto and which many easier/starter sport routes. This year if I ever went on a weekend it was just slammed with people - many of which seemed like new climbers.
I think Nemo would be helpful, its very busy with people who don't always know how to LNT
I think it would be great to do that. Rattlesnake Point would be huge. So many people go out there with next to no clue. 
Mount Nemo and [...] draw in many climbers, so they can be targeted.
Mount Nemo perhaps? Seems to be the busiest sports crag around Toronto.
nemo
nemo and rattlesnake due to high volume use
Nemo - as I feel it gets quite busy  there because it is fairly close
Nemo claenup day. And also possibly make a good name for ourselves at unestablished potential crags.
Nemo is definitely is a spot where I think a volunteer in front with some information is useful, maybe even paired with some park ranger or environmental group to show of some local species of plants, bugs, snakes... Etc... 
Nemo.
Nemo. Most likely to get alot of climbers
Nemo & Rattlesnake
Nemo. That place is the most populated sport crag and needs more maintenance and representation!
Nemo
I think there should be more at nemo and rattelsnake as these get lots of new climbers who do dangerous things because of little knowledge and tend to be the ones who littre and do not care for the crag.
I would target Nemo and [...] as they are the most populated and tend to have a lot of newcomers.
Target Nemo and Rattlesnake too
target Rattlesnake and Mt Nemo. They are a high traffic area and accessible for first time outdoor climbers, as well as hikers. Both could use education on safety and conservation, and proper anchor techniques.
Maintain a presence at mount nemo
Would target other high traffic crags, including offering services to nemo
Popular crags close to metro areas such as nemo and rattlesnake, the most likely areas to find new outdoor climbers who could most benefit from such programs. I would consider occasional volunteering.
"popular" crags which sees new climbers who are less likely to demonstrate climbing/outdoor etiquette eg Nemo
I would support such a program. Family commitments would prevent me from volunteering however. Nemo would be a good candidate.
Nemo
Great idea! [...] and rattlesnake. This will also teach hikers valuable stewardship lessons
Nemo, Rattlesnake
Target area with high traffic of newer climbers like Nemo [...]
Nemo
Mount Nemo
Rattlesnake Point, and Mt. Nemo
This might also be done in partnership with Halton Conservation at the pay booth. The attendee would ask if the entrant is doing any climbing, and then provide documents if that is the case. Some sort of brochure and a OAC sticker to show support, with a pledge that says "I pledge to be a good steward for Ontario climbing and access"
Nemo

# BV (21)
the swamp, and devils Glen in particular.. also parking issues at Devil's Glen.
[...] Metcalf would be my suggestions as they are perceived by me to be the most frequented by novice climbers.  I don't have the knowledge or skill set to make recommendations.
A presence at Old Baldy or the Swamp would be useful as those crags have a wider variety of moderate routes for gym climbers going outside for the first time. 
I avoided Devils Glen all last season due to crowds, disrespectful people and garbage!
Somewhat hard to at other crags like Devils Glen or Swamp because no real place top at up a tent or table unless in the parking lot.
Swamp & DG
Great idea! Metcalf and [...]. This will also teach hikers valuable stewardship lessons
I enjoy being at metcalfe. Old baldy. Swamp and devils glen.
I like it. The Swamp, Devils Glenn, Old Baldy, [...].  Not sure how I would run this.
Metcalf and [...] get alot of traffic so I would target those.
Metcalfe and devils Glen could use a presence on weekends to provide education on stewardship
Metcalfe is disgusting and frequently full of large groups of gym folks who don’t even all own their own harnesses. I’ve seen people making too much noise, endangering others trying to communicate from belay station to ground etc, setting fires, going off trail forraging for wild leeks etc, camping out on the warm up routes all day and switching out harnesses.
Metcalfe,
DG
Target area with high traffic of newer climbers like [...] DG, Metcalfe.
Old Baldy
Would definitely target some of the harder accessible ones such as the swamp.
devils glen
old baldy (parking lot issues last season).
Dg swamp
Swamp. I've seen a lot more garbage. We had to remove a ladder from someone's photo shoot.

lions head
Lions' head.
LionsHead
Lion's Head
lions head provincial park.
lions head
Lions Head. Maybe a booth at the trailhead where members could sign up for the OAC and learn about their activities
Lion's Head
Lions Head
Lions head is a priority in my opinion
Lion's head might need to use this as well
Lions head or any other popular crag
Lion’s Head to maintain access with the local municipality and the provincial authorities.
Lions head, trailhead presence?
Lions head, whites bluff [...]. Popular areas that will eventually have access issues come up due to a lack of mentor ship in the community.
Lion's Head. With climbing becoming more popular and with more people going, I have observed and heard of unsafe behaviors from my peers out there. People don't take safety checks, safe behaviors (rope managemnt, rappelling knowledge, seriously enough out there.)  
Crags to focus on would be those with high volumes of climbers or sensitive access: Lions head [...]

# HWLD
Halfway Log Dump

# Niagara Glen (12)
Niagara Glen
Niagara Glen
Very important. The Glen is definitely a spot that needs more attention for cleaning up
Some of the busier crags could use stewards. Niagara Glen see loads of new to outdoor climbers, as does [...]. I would be interested in helping with this for sure.
Niagara Glen
I think maintaining a presence at other crags is vital. OAC should be present at every crag possible! I would definitely target Niagara Glen as it is the most popular. Since Niagara is a hot spot for new climbers, I think it is important to raise awareness to climbing etiquette more so here than anywhere else!
Niagara Glen
Niagara Glen
Niagara Glen. Especially because it's such a frequented crag. I think the first step is awareness. Maybe a first step would be to create OAC member patches that members could wear while in the crag identifying them as people that can be openly approached for information.
Niagara Glen
Niagara glen? I don’t Boulder so not sure what’s going on there but it seems like there is some te soon between climbers and other user groups - ie why do climbers have to pay to be there when we are the ones picking up everyone else’s garbage?
[...] and the Niagara Glen draw in many climbers, so they can be targeted.

# Rockwood (4)
Rockwood
Rockwood. Demonstrate good climbing ethics so the crag gets reopened
Rockwood- Not sure how
Rockwood. This should be a HUGE focus of the OAC.

# Ice
Ice climbing in Southern Ontario.  Having topos of every crag online is also good! FQME is a good example of both.


# Gyms
Gyms are a gathering point for many climbers and good way to reach the community.

# Misc comments
all crags that you can find people to help out at. I'd put a priority on those that attract the most new outdoor climbers, to get more early intervention with people who need it to stay safe and treat the outdoors with proper respect.
All Southern Ontario crags have seen a huge increase in traffic. Some behaviour is baffling. OAC presence might improve ethics. Local ambassadors?
Any area that requires help, probably most in the province ice included.
Basically any of the popular crags that are extremely popular with both climbers and non-climbers
Good but dont want to have to pay admin fees
Great idea. Access sensitive crags and crags that are frequently visited by newer climbers.
I like this idea. I would love even crag and cliff maintenance including bolt refreshment, chose removal etc.
I'm going to use this space to beg for some kind of action preventing regular hikers or children to STOP throwing sticks or rocks or trash down the cliff. It's probably ignorance, but there are no signs up at Nemo saying that there may be people climbing or hiking  at the bottom of the cliff. I had two friends hit by debris on the same, and it put a real damper on the day.
I think a lot of the closed crags need to be monitored despite there closure. Also an effort to reduce traffic at nemo and the swamp to promote better stewardship there.
I think it’s a good idea but can’t contribute much to what or how.
I think you should concentrate on crags with questionable access
Larger presence at atrisk locatins.
North western Ontario crags. Educate climbing community so they can educate local populations.
Overwhelmed
Presence would be a good idea.
Southern Ontario at popular climbs.
The ones to target are the ones in danger of having access revoked. Unless, perhaps, there is already another organization there (Alpine Club at Bon Echo, for instance.)
where there are issues. YES!
