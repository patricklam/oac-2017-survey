How can the OAC encourage good climber behaviour?

# Internet (N=29)
Videos, posts on what to do, not to do
Better on line information re closures ,  and potential closures.
Improved social media, and definitely not suggesting the shaming of certain groups of people.
it sounds kinda corny, but sponsored posts on social media  with strong local climbers
Continue fostering awareness with engagement through social media channels.
FB ads work. Reminding ppl what they are supposed to do and against what they should not.  Use pictures. Ppl don’t read
Social media
Social media
Social media adds (done with humor on what not to do)
social media
Social media contests, presence at the Crag, more cleanup days that earn free day passes, offer a raffle for a guided climb for those who do their part
social media
Social media posts
Social media posts detailing missteps which may not be obvious to everyone might help
Info On social media
Post encouraging proper ettiquiet
social media, youtube videos
Highlight positive examples of good climber behaviour via social media.
I'm not sure they can. Some people are just assholes. Maybe social media campaigns shaming poor etiquette.
Repost the AccessFund gorilla videos at least once a year
Regular social media posts would reach most people I think.
Post examples of good and bad stewardship.
Post on Facebook climbing gyms and [...]. Especially In the spring.
Same as outreach - social media, [...]

Newsletters about access
Newsletters as above
[...], emails, social media
Share good stories on social media.  And poor behaviours that have been addressed.

# At the crag (N=26)
Lead by example
Be an advocate. Encourage climbers to learn outdoor climbing etiquette; encourage them to speak out and teach others when they see someone doing something wrong outdoors. Also better and more signage at crags and gyms to raise awareness to this.
Be at the crag. Lead by example.
Building a strong network/community of climbers can put on additional social pressure to be responsible
By example!
By maintaining a crag presence, we can better ensure climbers are following our ethics.
Community building and get togethers.
Having a presence at crags
Expansion of the Halfway Log Dump-type program would go a long way. A lot of new gym climbers are just completely unaware of what good behaviour looks like in the outdoors. They may never have engaged in any kind of outdoor activity before, and unless there are good role models around it's going to be hard for them to learn.
Education and presence at the cliff, online and otherwise.
Encourage climbers to be respectful of each other and have climbers keeping other climbers accountable for their actions.
Encourage climbers to communicate to each other at the crag. Ask if you don’t know/Share if you know.
climber education days
presence at crags
More stewardship programs would be great and to be more friendly. Some of the "old-school" members tend to be quite rude at the crags and this isn't an encouraging attitude.
Possibly through an ethics-ambassador programme, or some such thing. Posters encouraging people to become ambassadors, and t- shirts available for purchase for those who would like to be identified as such. I would love to be a part of such a thing. The tshirts would make it easier for those who are less likely to speak up to share their (our) views.  
Providing information via [...], in person
Maintain a visible presence of some form at all outdoor climbing areas
teach them how to be good climbers, teach them that driving from the GTA to kolapore doesn't constitute being "up in the sticks" or "so far north" that the rules of decency don't apply anymore.  Shitting beside trails, dumping coffee cups and garbage, chopping a tree down and building a fire.   All things I have seen someone from the GTA do.

## Infrastructure/signage (N=7)
Provide designated seated areas in crags so as not to disturb natural growth. 
trailhead booths
Have a list of guide lines at each crag posted at the start of the trail
Signs at crags
Information brochure at entrances.
billboards in parks.
Poster boards

# More output (N=20)
Remind climbers that crags can disappear. I still think most people assume you can climb anywhere you want. They don’t  know it’s a priveledge.
being more vocal to more people. sometimes the OAC seems like this obscure group that doesn't seem to engage much, even if it does quite a bit!
Connect poor behaviour with reduced climbing access - this should resonate with climbers
Constant communication with all climbers
Continue to advocate
Continue to engage and educate
Continuous affirmation
Do's and don't are good. No top down approach. Friendly tips.
Do’s & don’t parady video
educate new climbers on proper ethics for outdoor climbing
Education and engagement, perhaps even mandatory at longer events
Education I don't know
Not sure, maybe just reminding what we have access to and how we could lose it if we don't behave well.
Get more media in front of more climbers. Updated gym posters, hand out cards with ethics tips that can be given to offenders at the crag by volunteers or engaged members.
Reiterated messaging on all platforms at all events.
I think most folks have common sense.  Sometimes, friction with land owners can be a problem because of old/incorrect access information.   having a single source for this info would help.
Through continuous engagement with the climbing community. Maintaining a platform through which to remind people, beyond the one time donation they make for membership. Kind of like what Bob Barker did at the end of every Price is Right episode when he reminded ppl to spay and neuter their pets. Steady repetition of the messaging.
Just remind people of the benefits to being clean. And keeping a bit of a low profile.
Knowledge is key. Examples of what can happen if we don't, like loss of climbing at a crag
Raise awareness of people who show bad behavior (ex how Ontario climbing showed a pic of graffiti at the glen and asked people to help out). The climbing community is self policing. No judge mental posts like that terrible campaign for not sleeping in parking lots

# Mentoring (N=16)
create mentorship program
Member-at-large training program could include best practices.
Mentorship programs?
Mentorship programs.
I don't think there's really any solid punishment or reward system for encouraging good behaviour. Good behaviour (in terms of environment) is kind of something that has always been hand in hand with climbing (or a love of the outdoors in general). I think perhaps a mentorship for new climbers wanting to go out to crags to go with more established climbers who can teach "leave no trace" and having a general respect for the crag would maybe work?
bKeep encouraging experienced climbers to mentor newer climbers at the crag. Or even mentor them at the gym. Any kind of mentor ship helps builds awareness and understanding of general climbing etiquette.
Mentorships, safety clinics, addressing complaints/concerns brought to the organization
Make sure people are well educated and everyone sets and example for each other at the crag

## Peer pressure (N=9)
Practice what they preach. I've seen OAC members do whatever they want at crags. Set a good example.
Practice what you preach
Peer pressure - establish social norms of behaviour within the community
Make it socially unacceptable to behave otherwise.
Small reminders. But it's all up to the community to take initiative
Setting good examples, calling out people who aren't showing good climber behaviour.
Some climbers seem to be unaware how their actions affect the community as a whole, i am not sure how to do so but the community needs to be more unified.
While I enjoy speaking to others with whom I climb things that I've learned about maintaining these places that we all love, a t-shirtwould communicate, even to those to who only pass by, and with whom I may not speak, the responsibility shared by all of us to care for our crags.
I think talking to people can make a big impact. Maybe have an "unsung hero(ine)" part of the newsletter, and recognize people who are working to reduce impact at cliffs. 

# Gyms (N=15)
information sessions at gyms.
Actually engage gym climbers. These are not just for “outdoor climbers”. The gym climbers will trickle in, make sure they do it the right way instead of acting protectionist.
Advocate the gyms teach a short section on it in their lead courses?
An OAC gym-to-crag program that could be delivered by local guides or gym staff
gym posters
gym info sessions
Having marketing materials at climbing gyms for new climbers.
Posters and discussion at climbing gyms. That's where the new people come from
Set up posters in climbing gyms
Outreach and educational info at indoor gyms
“Post your best practices at the crag and be entered for a weekly/monthly draw” on social media
Post on [...] and in gyms. Especially In the spring.
gym and MEC visits
Word of mouth from gyms
Presentations at climbing gyms. Make a short movie on ontario climbing with some locals climbing classic routes. Take it to gyms in the gta. Use that to showcase what ontario has to offer and use it as an opportunity to discuss ethics and good behaviour.

# Courses/events (N=12)
Education. There aren't enough mentors to teach new climbers about these skills anymore, so the OAC should run classes/daytrips from gym to crag
have more members be knowledgeable, and equipped with ways to approach other climbers when we're out
Running events where this is discussed
perhaps run a leave no trace course or become part of the organization if not all ready part of.
Gym to craig course
Have workshops for the basics, LNT.
Outdoor clinics in the summer with free goodies.
More cleanups/events that get climbers interacting with each other/members, offer education at these events (A Halton cleanup could include a guided nature walk for instance)
events
Weave cultural norms into presentations/clinics so as not to bash people over the head with rules/regulations. Display the historical stewardship culture engendered with climbing in language/beahviour/demonstrations.
Crag clean up efforts throughout the season at most crags.
More cleanup days, with prizes.

# Prizes (N=5)
Acknowledge good behaviour with rewards at the crag
collaborate with MEC or other outdoor stores to get prizes - publicly mention a climber each month on social media and the good deed they did for access or environment or the safety of climbers and reward them with a prize.
Incentives for stewardship would be cool (trading bags of trash picked up or packed out for specialized content/beta could work)
Incentivize good behaviour with gear rewards.
Potentially create an annual good deed award. Given at a climbing festival. Ie beaver valley...

# Keep up the good work
Feel like the OAC already does this through education and social media
Keep on keeping on


# Other
Stress fragile access
Show them the possibility of closing crags.
Through education and possibly through access rights revocation to parks for gross violators
Generate a larger member base.
guidebook info
Unfortunately, money speaks. Imposig fine would be the most effective
Having the ACC set a better example.
Helping people understand the consequences of a few on the group. That and helping to provide reasonable solutions ... climber campgrounds in the way the New and Red have campgrounds would be a great way to get that ball rolling.
If I could legally ice climb in Elora, then I would not be engaging in bad climber behaviour. It seems that compared to FQME the OAC does not work as hard to make crags accessible for ice climbing.
Implement a fee system that contributes to maintainance and infrastructure, and reduces foot traffic. Similar to the gunks.
Keep the indoor sport climbers inside
Public shaming.  
I think that getting more young people aware of etiquette is important. Large groups of young new climbers at the crag hogging all the classics is a big problem.
also perhaps by contacting local organizations: climbing gyms, where many people get their start; the Alpine Club, of course; guides; well-known/respected/admired climbers who will be listened to if they gently suggest or just demonstrate good climber behaviour.
With spikes sticks
Providing statistics on accidents, teach and not lecture when you see a problem.

# Dunno
Unknown
Hard to say...
Beatings and shaming. Uh, or no suggestion.
is that even possible?
Not sure.
not sure.
I'm not sure. I think most climbers are well behaved. The bad ones arn't going to change beacuse the OAC told them to.
Really? That is the challenge. People can be frustrating.
