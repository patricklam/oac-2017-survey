What could we be doing better in our relationships with land managers?

# Signage
Signage to hikers and climbers of what not to do eg throwing rocks and sticjs off edges of cliffs where climbers are below
[...] and maybe more visible presence at the crags (if they would allow permanent signs of sort).
Better signage (parking areas/no parking). Help identify access issues caused by climbers vs. other usage groups (i.e. hikers).

# Climber communications
Keep all OAC members informed of the status for the relationships.
Teach climber's how to respect the land. Teach climber's to bring issues to the OAC first, rather than post individually on social media.
Better climber education and [...]
Communicate that relationship to climbers... Seeing the conservation areas be more supportive of climbers
More of the same where the general community can help out.

# Buy land
Start a campaign to buy the land from them like in RRG
Buy their land! That happened many times in Canada with financial support from MEC.

# Change society
Look to the deep rooted history of Europe's climbing as an example. It is accepted as part of the culture.

# More crags
keep climbing areas open.
More closed than open, and those that are open are "tolerated". That makes me worried for the future.

## Rockwood
Rockwood.

## Tiffany Falls
Tiffany falls was only opened for people who wanted to pay to go with a guide or with the alpine club (pay to be part of so still paying)... Tiffany falls is not open for everyday people who want to go ice climbing so saying there is access is bullshit
I question the claimed "victory" at tiffany falls since climbers are still not allowed their outside of access events and one axe programs. Work with land managers to increase signage directly targetting climbers and discussing best practices.

## BTC
Can we find a way to work with the BTC? Their hostility towards climbing has always befuddled me a little bit, but it seems together the two organizations could muster a decent amount of purchasing power when private sections of escarpment come up for sale.
i am not sure how much engagement has been done with the bruce trail conservancy but i think it may be good to collaborate with them further because most of our climbing areas are on areas which share with bruce trail - working together for access may strengthen our voice and increase our numbers.

# Better relationships
Help them understand that climbing is no more harmful to their lands than hiking or mountain biking is. 
Ensure communication of events listed above and other stories from OAC and ACC efforts.
educate these people about climbing, and the misconceptions that exist about climbers in the general public, that we don't harm the environment, and can actually be good for the local economies
Build an actual relationship with them (coffees, lunch, whatever), info sessions, learn about each other, approach it with curiosity and collaborative intent.
Be sure to invite land managers to key OAC events.
Communicating the value of climbing not just as an activity but as a means of conservation and education and environmental stewardship better
Continue to be active and show how climbers can help, and not hurt land managers.
Actual face time with them via media. We don't know who they are and people often blame government, or grca, etc.  Giving a face may assist in the understanding that issues are trying to be solved where problems exist.
more proactive communication with landowners/conservation areas, promote climbing access. (GRCA etc.)
Better communication
Regularly keep in contact to ensure there isnt a problem that goes unresolved.
Take them out climbing? Show them the benifits? Or just scare them silly
open seminars at town halls encouraging land owners of cliffs to come participate.  Knock on their door and ask if they have issues.
Private land owners also need to be engaged. Generally i feel the OAC does a good job at this
Regular communication, like at least once a month. Sitting in on land manager/local community meetings. Helping with their conservation efforts by promoting/sending volunteers to their events.
Promoting climber environmentalism... assuring climbers are into that anyway. I know I am.
Promote climbing as a safe activity that has low impact on envrionment.
I’m unsure. Perhaps approaching land managers at existing climbing destinations to open dialogue to open closed cliffs but also to maintain a relationship with those who manage existing open cliffs.
Wine and dine them more? Open rockwood
Publicly thank them
Show our continued appreciation for them via social media.
Not sure. Besides keep them updated on special events. Good practices. Special award in there name? Given out once again at a festival..
be open, show commitment to land conservation/preservation
I admittedly don't know a lot about what is being done, do I can't comment too well on this. With this in mind I would say the most important things is keeping in mind the POV of the land manager. Educating them as best possible is key about climbing, what may happen re: injuries, damage to nature, traffic etc and where, when, how they may be liable.
I don’t feel like I know enough about existing land manager-OAC relationships to expand on this. I suppose always make sure there is clear communication between parties, and that land managers always have a simple, direct method of communicating concerns with the OAC.
Improve access and sell climbing as a viable  commercial activity- especially regional muicipalities and government managers.
## Get them climbing
Making sure they have an understanding and maybe taking them out to do some climbs
Encorpoate a way for them to try the sport

# Events
More crag cleanup days
Trail building / maintenance is often appreciated as well.

# Insurance
Maybe a search and rescue insurance program so land owners aren’t worried about independent use. Why should I be limited to ice climbing at Tiffany falls during an ACC event?

# Occupiers Liability Act education for landowners
Educate them on the laws. I have spoken to a few land owners who have said I cannot climb on their property because they will get sued if I hurt myself.
Having more information, printable info pages for land owners for new crags

# Manage impact
Promote discretion. People will climb at closed crags like Rockwood and stuff. However, a line of cars and people there on a Saturday is not a good idea. This makes land managers angry for sure.
Clear understanding of where bolting can be done and have very specific people allowed to complete the work.
Having land managers assess and survey the listing impacts of climbing, and discourage access in environments where those impacts are not sustainable.

# Provide services
I think providing land managers with regular services such as garbage pick up, or land maintenance  would help keep up our relationships with them. These services could be turned into full-scale events to raise awareness for the OAC. Win-Win.
Develop unique solutions. EG. In Chattanooga, you can actually text a landowner to tell them you're there. They have a tip jar on their crag. It's a strange solution but it could work. Or ask for specific waivers for areas.
Bring them fresh bread. That works for us

# Thanks
great job so far? maybe better cross promotion via social media?
I think you have done an excellent job in maintaining these relationships and also advertising this on social media so people are aware.
I think your efforts are on the right track!
I think we're doing fine just keep being clean and don't hike or climb in banned areas. Unless you have land owner permission.
Not sure there's much! Great job!
Yes
You guys are doing a fair bit. Not sure what else with limited resources
You're doing a great job, continue to keep lines of communication open, continuously ask for their input
? You seem to be doing well
Doing great so far.
Ensure climbers are being good land users. Listen to land manager and climber concerns and respond accordingly - which is what OAC already does.
Keep doing exactly what you're doing. Obviously more resources (esp people to spend the time) would help

# Other
Open relations with climbing gyms to reach the climbing community
Expand them to northern Ontario.
Finding legal loopholes to go around them.
More open access. 


# Unsure
Kind of an inside baseball question isn't it? How do we know what you are already doing?
Honestly no idea. But I'm interested in learning more
I am not involved enough to criticize.
I am not really aware of the details your current relationship with land managers
I am really not versed nearly enough on the topic to answer helpfully.
Sorry some of my prior comments are probably irrelevant as I’m not aware of the extent of your relationships with land managers currently. This is also something I’m interested in volunteering to assist with but would require much more information. Are there MOUs in place that can be reviewed?
Don't know it well enough to say
Don't know what you're doing now
Dunno.
I don't know.
I don’t know anything about this.
I honestly don't have much experience in this area.
I know nothing about this, and would like more information.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure exactly how the current relationships with land managers are presented. It's hard to answer a question like this.
I'm not sure, would need to better understand the challenges and opportunities here -- but would be interested in engaging further
