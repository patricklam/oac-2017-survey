Do you engage in protecting climbing environments currently? Do you intend to do so in the future? If so, how?

# Infrastructure
Calabogie requires a new trail at the base along with bridges. 
by flagging trails and developing climbing sites.

# Practices
Absolutely. By practising leave no trace, minimising noise while climbing, being conscious of implications of chalk use and anchor choices. Would love to get more involved here
Absolutely, I develop new climbing areas in north eastern Ontario and constantly bring new people out and be extremely honest with them about any negative things they're doing. Get them involved with development in all aspects and get them informed at the crag AND at the gym. Being approachable and open to discussion with new climbers is key
Actively pick up other people’s garbage, don’t touch cedars, stay on path as much as possible, was rapping to prevent wear on anchor rings (will lower now).
Always ensuring to reduce my footprint at the crag - never disturbing the surroundings and ensure all garbage & waste is taken out with me.
Always pack out trash and repair areas where some BS (like campfires etc) have happened.
Always picking up extra garbage on the way out.
As much as I can
Be a good steward. Keep my environment impact to a minimum. Observe others around me and note if there unsafe behaviors, to speak up.
By reducing my personal impact - lunches in plastic containers, packing out human waste/garbage, staying on main trails, avoiding plant life while on the cliffs and approaching, climbing with one partner at a time..
Carry out everything you bring in, encourage responsible climbing etiquette
Clean up litter where ever possible and tread lightly everywhere.
crag clean-ups are great!
Crag clean ups. Continue to be a steward for the areas.
... do sling cedar trees!
Garbage cleanup, invasive plant removal, education through personal guiding work/guidebook/online guidebook/online forum/in person at the crag.
Help with the OAC, ACC. Ensure that I practice and promote leave no trace, and act as mentors to others who are new or learning.
I actively pick up trash at the crag
I always carry a garbage bag to the crag and try to leave with someting in it
I am a conservationist, have always tried to practice leave no trace, and act in such a way that best guarantees future access to climbing areas. I do my best to pack out others' trash, and educate those at the crag regarding best practices.
I do. Always clean up. Always. Just by good practice.
I do and I will continue to do so. Practice leave no trace principles
I do my best to be low impact on the environment. I seek out crag info before I go. I hire a guide if I am unsure. I help new climbers by passing on good habits.
I do my best to leave the crag cleaner than I found it. Picking up some extra garbage on the way out every time, brushing unneeded tick marks, and teaching those I go with to do the same.
I do not but i would be interested in doing so.
I don’t but would like to as I become more immersed and learn more about what is needed.
I don’t currently aside from talking to climbers if I see any bad behaviour. Not sure how I could do more but would like to.
I don't go to events but if I see garbage on the ground I throw it away.
I don't help, tbh. I keep to myself, climb in small numbers and leave no trace.
I engage in good practices when climbing outdoors ex. No littering, no loud music, etc
I intend to participate in one of the cleanup days
I just bring a bag for garbage, even if I won't be producing trash that day... expanding on the "leave nature as you found it" motto, and actually pick up extra trash if I come across it.
I just do my best to clean the areas that I climb in
I leave it better than I found it. Remove visible climbing impacts. Pack out others garbage. Yell at jerks
I make sure to leave no trace. I tried to do this with the environmental committee for Kitchener. Each city should have one. It might be good to connect with them and see if you can partner up with them. I tried but got sick and couldnt cont.
I mean not really in an organized fashion. My partner and I always bring an extra plastic bag or two when we go out and fill it with garbage we come across during the day (The Glen has the most litter btw).
I’m part of Bruce trail conservatory.  And will soon contribute to the oac.  However I lead by example at crags.
Intend to do so more often.
I, on an occasion, remind other climbers to keep it clean, but it doesn't usually go well for me. I always pick up whatever garbage I see at the crags.
I pick up after myself and try to pick up if I see garbage left around.
I pick up garbage at crags
I pick up garbage when I’m at the crag if that counts. I don’t know.
I pick up whenever I am at a crag and see something. But I don’t live near enough to help more often
I practice leave no trace, and general environmental stewardship. clean up days at high traffic crags would be something I would get involved with
I preach by example.
I teach outdoor rock climbing. I always emphasize to my students that we are in a shared environment, and so we have to make sure that we make it so that everyone (even people not in our group) can enjoy themselves in it. And I talk about "no trace" ethics. I like to help with cleanup days when I'm in town. I'd like to volunteer with the OAC if I can manage it while I travel.
I try my best to clean out the crag at every visit. I also usually remove garbage from other users other than climbers. However I have never been to a group crag cleaning event.
I try my best to educate friends who are new to climbing on crag etiquette. Always practice leave-no-trace.
I try to act responsibly and 
I try to lead by example. We always travel in small groups,  take home more garbage than what we take/ make.
I try to mentor new climbers. I always bring a milk bag to the crag and pack out anything i find
I usually clean up garbage at the crag whenever I go.
I would like to but don't know a whole lot about it beyond not leaving a mess or hanging stuff in trees.
I would like to, not sure how
I wrote a letter as part of the NEP review, but otherwise am not very active. I work in environmental consulting and could give my spin on agency / environmental group liaison in the future if desired.
Just a respectful climber.
Leave no trace, monetary support of OAC, Access Fund, RRGCC
Maybe? I'm not sure what qualifies as engagement
Minimally. I will carry out garbage i see at the crag or hike in. Not much else
NVCA volunteer, cleaning trails, cleaning chalk and tick marks (wether mine or not).  picking up garbage.
Of course
of course.
Other than personal responsibility and agency I havnt
Packing others garbage out of crags.
Pack out a garbage typically on the departure of each crag.
Pack out and OAC member
Personal stewardship, leading newer climbers to outdoor areas and showing them by instruction and example. Engagement with public efforts (often led/announced by OAC) to interface with government or public institutions to promote protection.
Picking up trash, as well as I wrote a letter when access was threatened for Lion's Head. I will continue these types of behaviours.
Picking up trash is a start.
Pick up a garbage pretty much every time i'm at rattlesnake or nemo.
Practice pack in/pack out. I would like to get involved more
Pull out garlic mustard when I see it. Encourage safe and respectful behaviour in my party and others while at the crag. Teach the younger generation about proper crag stewardship.
respectfully
Simple things like local trash cleanup when we see it, or asking others to do the same. I have not done a stewardship activity due to time, but would donate
So far, I've just been trying to be aware of what I'm doing myself. I pack out any trash, even if not my own. I will recommend better practices to other climbers as I see them (for example, saw a guy and his team rap off cedars at Mt. Nemo).
Spring of 2018.
Stay on trail. Pack it in, pack it out mentality. Leave it better than you found it.  Etc.
stick to the trail, carry in/carry out,
strict with friends about music and littering
Teaching those who aren't protecting the environment how to do so in a friendly way
Try to make sure new climbers aren’t doing dumb ass shit
We don't climb with large groups. We keep to ourselves and practice good crag etiquette. Our dog does come with us but is leashed 100% of the time and we keep him off the trail at the base of the cliff as much as we can. We practice leave no trace, which means bringing along our own plastic bags to pack out every shred of toilet paper (and regular garbage).
What do you mean?  I take my stuff out. Pack it in, pack it out. Including toilet paper, food, garbage. I do not disrupt the off trail environment unnecessarily etc.
What do you mean with engage? I try to have a garbage bag with me and pick up trash that I see when I go climbing outside. Apart from that no, but maybe in the future.
Yes

Yes, I calming talk to people doing questionable things at the crags. Also by cleaning up trash I find.
Yes I do, but not as much as I would like to. I follow ethics that I'm aware of and try to increase my awareness. I clean up trash I find and try to make those around me aware of the importance of our behaviour as a factor in conservation of environment as well as conservation of access.
Yes I do. I keep a garbage bag in my pack and use it whenever I see refuse at the crag. I pack out what I bring in.
Yes.  I keep locations secret.  For known crags, I use rap rings or leave some behind.
Yes - I strongly believe in leaving no trace at the climbing environments that I visit. I intend to do this for as long as I live, through volunteering at the OAC, spreading the word about climbing etiquette where I can, and teaching new climbers how to behave outdoors.
Yes, it is very important to protect the cedars at Rattlesnake by not wrapping down them. I do my best to educate people on its importance.
Yes, I volunteer with the OAC.
Yes, leave no trace.
Yes. My job entails environmental stewardship. In part helps with climbing

Yes. Point it out to anyone who does not do everything possible to protect the environment.
Yes. Proper and sustainable crag development
Yes, via donations to the appropriate groups and participating in clean ups.
Yes - volunteering at crag cleanups.
Yup. Just packing out stuff making sure people don’t pee under overhangs, keeping group sizes small and educating people the best I can at my gym.

# No
no
no, but I would be interested in learning about opportunities
No, but I would love to get involved
No. I do not currently engage in this.
No. Maybe. Ensure how.
Not actively. Support OAC and ACC, set good example, share knowledge
Not at the moment, but  I do in the future. Attend a crag cleanup.
Not currently and am too  isy at work atm to get involved. But am open to the future
Not currently, other than financially (see Access Fund and to some very limited degree, the OAC). I'd be interested in knowing how.Tal
Nothing formal. I bring a garbage to the crag typically.
Not in a wildly active way.  I pick up as much garbage as I can whenever I am at the crag and of course stay on marked trails, clean chalk etc, and encourage best behaviour from other climbers as well. Many people just don't know what is appropriate/ inappropriate at the crag and are very happy to chat about it, and I'm happy to share.
Not sure.

# Other

I am vocal at the crag and the gym in promoting responsible climbing ethics but have been disenchanted in the past with the OAC. The attitude and actions of some members of the board have left me uninterested in volunteering more directly. After the guidebook fiasco the OACs endorsement of Gus's book and not Jesse's seemed like a poor stance for the organization to take. I question the integrity of the OAC in endorsing a book that contains detailed beta on accessing numerous closed crags and which, regardless of the author's intent, will result in increased traffic to these areas. The impression persists that the OAC is an insider's club, out of touch with the community, and looking out for their own interests and not the community's.
