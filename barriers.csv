Transportation, time

Lack of commitment
Lack of commitment
Selfishness, a shortage of free time
People are lazy and selfish. The types of "jobs" available are ultimately glamorous. Some volunteers have felt rejected, unwanted, or have been generally ignored.

Time. We only have so much of it, and there are too many aspects of each of our lives that require our time. Some of them more valid and rewarding than others, but they are there.

Commute/ work-life balance
Finishing up my undergrad
Little time to volunteer

# Awareness (N=46)
Communication is definitely a major barrier. OAC needs more than one volunteer coordinator in order to properly give time to designate to OAC events.
Aside from being a good crag steward, it's hard to know what talents the OAC needs from volunteers. Just being another climber doesn't give people a direct way of knowing how that can translate into making a difference.
Available positions
A more obvious/ formal volunteer process?
Difficulty finding information or positions on how to volunteer
Don't know about their needs
Don't know enough about it
Don’t know how
Don't know how I can help out.
Don’t know what events/ opportunities to volunteer
Lack of information in how
lack of knowledge
lack of understanding of opportunities, few opportunities, timing of opportunities
who do I contact?
I am more than willing to help out with the OAC, but as I am generally unaware of the initiatives, it's difficult to tell what's happening at a given point in time, or whether help is needed.
I do not believe that I have any relevant skills
I don't know what kind of commitment the OAC requires. I would like to volunteer, but I travel a lot for work and would not be able to attend meetings in person. Would this be an issue? That's one example.
Not aware of needs of the organization
Not aware this was an option
Not enough awareness
Not enough awareness
Not enough offers to volunteer
I’ve never been ask to volunteer.
Knowledge and time
Knowledge of opportunities
hearing about what they're doing
Information on how and where to contribute
It can be a bit unclear what type of help is needed.
It's unclear what ongoing volunteer work can be assisted with
I've never heard about the OAC
Just don’t know how.
Not knowing enough about the OAC.
Not sure im needed, but if you are interested id be down to help!!!
Not sure what the opportunities area
The who, what, when, where.
Unaware of how to participate
Unclear what the objective is
Volunteer opportunities that fit with my work/climbing schedule
Not knowing how I can help - provide specifics and I'll be able to assess if I have capacity
People have to reach out to volunteer. I don't know how to get around that.
Opportunity and understanding
Maybe you should do a meet and greet night at various gyms so people would know who they would be working with.
money, time
More advertising to call for volunteers.
No knowledge of local activity
Non-awareness of opportunities to help.

# Location (N=18)
# response: we're not actually GTA-centric
Location
location
Location and free time
Location. I don’t live in Toronto and I think a lot of the events are based there or around there?
My location
My location - I live at least an hour from any Ontario crag, most are farther.
not living in Toronto
Proximity
convenient times/schedules, communication, dont want to take time away from climbing
Events in my locality (collingwood). Cleanups in GTA and Halfway Log are not of interest.  So many climbers come from the GTA dumping their garbage into my local crags that I am constantly cleaning trails.
Currently living in BC for school
Distance
Car
For me I don't have a car, so I would have a hard time going anywhere.
No car/driver's license of my own, so I cannot easily get to cleanup events etc.
Geography, time
GTA-centric

# Not welcoming (N=7)
Boy's Club. Suggestions are shot down too quickly.
Expectations and feeling like an equal member and part of a community
Very cliquey
The continued impression of the "old boys club". Continue to add younger, more gender diverse, and more racially diverse people to positions of leadership in the OAC. When your members see themselves more represented in the leadership of the OAC they will be more willing to engage.
Pre-conceived attitudes and notions of the "old boys club" of the OAC. Certain personality types that were in charge that weren't welcoming of the new fold and used judgement, public forums to "hang" people over engagement, inclusion, and education.  I know there has been a change in board member make-up, since. I look to it with hope.
Looks a lot like a high school clique at times. Competing instead of collaborating with some of the climbers in Ontario.
I have volunteered with the OAC, but something that made me hesitate was that it felt like a bit of an exclusive club to break into.

# None (N=6)

None, I volunteer.
None that I can see. Just my personal time is limited for now
No perceived barrier
Nothing so far

# Other (N=9)
Negative ontario climbing culture
Not enough northern Ontario representation
wide area encompassed by the OAC's mandate - includes ottawa to kenora to northern ontario.
Randy never called me back...
Sense of entitlement of younger climbers
Too many gumbys, not enough mentors
we are a sponsor.
Not sure
Not sure...
