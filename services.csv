What services could the OAC provide to the climbing community?

# Access (N=33)
continue being strong voice for access
representation in land use disputes, helping establish outdoor etiquette
Maintaining and improving access to Ontario climbing destinations.
Open closed crags
Access
Access issues.
Access, parking information, negotiate land, represent climbers and climbing to government when needed,
Access services, information
access to climbing areas
Addressing access issues
Already ensures access and shares information
advocacy to keep crags open and open new/closed crags
Apart from improved access and relationships with land managers and owners, nothing.
attempt to get closed crags reopened
Focus on access.
Getting closed crags reopened. Ex. Rockwood, Elora
Get us access to closed crags. 
Open more crags. Open rockwood
Open Rockwood.
liase with conservation areas/landowners about (re)bolting and access improvements/upgrades (trail building, parking issues/lot building, etc)
open up Campden and Rockwood and Kelso
Make rockwood open to climbing :)
Continued free/cheap access to outdoor climbing areas.
Continue to encourage more climbing access
Continue to work on access. Ie most recently old baldy.
Ideally more partnerships with land managers, in an effort to not have climbing viewed as running at cross-purposes with conservation. But I realize the OAC is not the reason there is no BTC-OAC partnership.
Keeping crags open
secure access to endangered crags and regain access to closed ones
Securing more access
Land purchase, trail upkeep (if applicable)
... and opening up more opportunities to the climbing community
.. as well as info on how to help with obtaining access to a crag.
Protect access

More education/training or some kind of outdoor courses for the many newcomers making the transition from gym to outdoor climbing. Lots of unsafe behaviors out there from ignorance and/or complacency.
Safety clinics would be huge, making the transition from gym to crag, helping people determine where it’s safe to climb outdoors.
safety clinics
Training
safety trainings
information courses (not just BVCF) get people to really know what they're doing out there, not learning from an obscure source and taking it as truth.  Sketchy situations abound at local crags from individuals who think they know, but really do not.

# Reach (N=2)
being part of the ontario climbing scene. not just southern ontario
I would like to see it better represented outside of Toronto

# Go OAC! (N=5)
I think you offer good services to the Ontario climbing community already (diplomacy and results!)
It’s doing grrreat!
Keep on keeping on.
So far so good - crag clean-ups, advocacy to keep crags open, information for climbers about rules at each crag, notifications about closed crags.
What OAC currently is doing is fine.

# Misc (N=3)
More than what they are doing now.
Stairs of craigslist and accessibility issues due to land use
Stop letting individuals bolt at cliffs which are closed/on private land without permission,  Beaver Valley has many micro crags with under 10 routes (all illegally put up without land owners consent)

Unknown
