How to share environmental info / best practices?

Encourage good climber behaviour?

Best way to educate those who just don't know that outdoors not climbing gym?

Do you engage in protecting climbing environments currently? Do you intend to do so in the future? If so, how?

selected responses:

By reducing my personal impact - lunches in plastic containers, packing out human waste/garbage, staying on main trails, avoiding plant life while on the cliffs and approaching, climbing with one partner at a time..
I make sure to leave no trace. I tried to do this with the environmental committee for Kitchener. Each city should have one. It might be good to connect with them and see if you can partner up with them.
I teach outdoor rock climbing. I always emphasize to my students that we are in a shared environment, and so we have to make sure that we make it so that everyone (even people not in our group) can enjoy themselves in it. And I talk about "no trace" ethics. I like to help with cleanup days when I'm in town. I'd like to volunteer with the OAC if I can manage it while I travel.

The OAC would like to develop conservation-related materials that might be presented as part of a gym-led gym-to-crag program. How could we make this happen?

What could we be doing better in our relationships with land managers?

selected responses:
Climbing advocates to discuss with land managers. Volunteer to take land managers out for a day to see the activities. Allow feedback both ways.


How could we better involve the climbing community in our relationship with land managers?
