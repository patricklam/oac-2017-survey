What services could the OAC provide?
TODO

Climbing presentation by the OAC?
Much support across a variety of speaker types, including locals.
[TODO: code this answer]

Selected responses:

I would go. The speaker needs to somehow help promote the OAC's goals rather than their personal "accomplishments."
I would like to hear more about ontario climbing history.
I would like to learn more about the history of climbing, the mental state of climbing, climbers pushing their limits, breaking barriers, paraclimbing.
Someone who has set routes at local crags, trad climbers, world travellers
Someone who not only inspires great feats of strength or dedication in climbing, but also in making it sustainable and continually accessible to all for years to come.

Best way to educate those who just don't know that outdoors not climbing gym?
TODO

Do you engage in protecting climbing environments currently? Do you intend to do so in the future? If so, how?

selected responses:

By reducing my personal impact - lunches in plastic containers, packing out human waste/garbage, staying on main trails, avoiding plant life while on the cliffs and approaching, climbing with one partner at a time..
I make sure to leave no trace. I tried to do this with the environmental committee for Kitchener. Each city should have one. It might be good to connect with them and see if you can partner up with them.
I teach outdoor rock climbing. I always emphasize to my students that we are in a shared environment, and so we have to make sure that we make it so that everyone (even people not in our group) can enjoy themselves in it. And I talk about "no trace" ethics. I like to help with cleanup days when I'm in town. I'd like to volunteer with the OAC if I can manage it while I travel.

The OAC would like to develop conservation-related materials that might be presented as part of a gym-led gym-to-crag program. How could we make this happen?

What could we be doing better in our relationships with land managers?

selected responses:
Develop unique solutions. EG. In Chattanooga, you can actually text a landowner to tell them you're there. They have a tip jar on their crag. It's a strange solution but it could work. Or ask for specific waivers for areas.
I admittedly don't know a lot about what is being done, do I can't comment too well on this. With this in mind I would say the most important things is keeping in mind the POV of the land manager. Educating them as best possible is key about climbing, what may happen re: injuries, damage to nature, traffic etc and where, when, how they may be liable.
I think providing land managers with regular services such as garbage pick up, or land maintenance  would help keep up our relationships with them. These services could be turned into full-scale events to raise awareness for the OAC. Win-Win.

How could we better involve the climbing community in our relationship with land managers?

selected responses:
Climbing advocates to discuss with land managers. Volunteer to take land managers out for a day to see the activities. Allow feedback both ways.
Have a land manager "spotlight" on the OAC website
Just becoming aware of this issue has made me a better climber, from a perspective of involvement with land management. Having a mindset of good relationship between ourselves and land management affects our behaviour in a positive way. Climbers ought to be ambassadors for our sport. I've been able to make comments about beneficial activity I've observed by other climbers to, specifically, Halton parks staff. I've also had parks staff observe me packing out trash that I've gathered during my climbing session. These behaviours, I believe, affect our relationship with land managers at a grass-roots level. 
Meeting each other in person. Land owners and climbers coming together. Social event? Or a meeting. Or at earth day...
