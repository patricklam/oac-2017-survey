The OAC would like to develop conservation-related materials that might be presented as part of a gym-led gym-to-crag program. How could we make this happen?

# Gyms
Get the gyms on board with it
engage with local gym communities.
Partnerships with gyms
Approach gyms about this
approach the gyms
Ask gyms to sponsor
By contracting gym managers and university climbing walls to see who would be interested in helping.   I think the biggest disconnect is the university climbing walls.
Convening a panel of Ontario gym managers. Also help from the ACC
Coordinate with gyms
Gotta be programs at indoor gyms. Or free volounteer course either indoor or outdoor crags. Good way to also promote oac. ... thinking that u pick a date and time at different locations.  Held annually around same time. Over a couple days. Like 9-11.  Sat and Sunday. Mid April? Across all of the crags. As climbers like to start early.
Collect information from the climbing community in order to get all of the basis covered and then publish the material at gyms in multiple formats.
Could engage with a college or university environmental and/or graphic design class to put some materials together? Try to Environmental Visual Communication program (Fleming College)
Gym presence and seminars
Have a presence in the gyms
partnership with gyms and lead climbing courses -- I'd be willing to help here
Work with gym owners to determine how to present gym vs. crag etiquette.
Work with climbing gyms and maybe have it as part of an event such as a movie night. Explain in story form so it is engaging.
Seems like a good idea. Just contact the various gyms in Toronto
Work with the gym owners and instructors- reach out to head lead climbing instructors and have them help with program delivery.
gym presence in GTA and everywhere within 2-3 h.
My local gym has an outdoors- skills course. I'm not aware of its content, but if gyms could incorporate ( as I'm sure many already do) these materials into such courses, that may be part of a solution.
maybe it would be a good Idea to get a representative from each gym, probably best if it is staff to be part of a project committee for this. They could develop signage and maybe a short course/ info session. This can be regular (once per month) with maybe a few extra early in the climbing season. 
Liability might make that hard.  Our gym will not allow us to rapel, practice cleaning or practice placing draws.  There would have to be a dedicated after hours class.
Gym advertising and social media
Disperse info through gyms, and social media.
Flyers and bulletin boards. Or maybe a volunteer to go to gyms and teach good practice.
events in the gym, posters to put up in gyms (simple, big list of things to remember like how to deal with poop, sport cleaning ethics, staying on trails, WHAT TO DO DURING AN EMERGENCY)
Engaging the gym staff, AND engaging regular members that have an influence on newcomers - I.e, coaches, or people with a "presence" online or in the gym that people will want to hear from. Obviously, they should already be good representatives outdoors as well.
Engage with gym staff to get buy in, develop evidence informed guidance, obtain funding for brochures, host presentations at gyms on this, post to social media about it

# Materials
A printable info sheet with illustrations.
Are you asking how to create print material to put in a gym? Use a graphic designer and print it at a print shop... then ask gym owners to hang it up. 
Create free to climbers content and get ads funding from gyms and other climbing related businesses.
I think this sounds like a great idea. Some gyms already have outdoor skills courses that would be a great way to distribute these materials. A somewhat standardized 'curriculum' for these courses might be helpful.
I've heard a lot of interest from climbers in a workshop based on this subject. I think if a few of the OAC board members created a curriculum based on gym-to-crag etiquette or a "How To" that a lot of people would come. Not only would this be a good way to convey the OAC's message, but it would be good for fund-raising! It would also encourage people to JOIN the OAC.
Develop a easy infographic, chart or poster to explain the different elements: risk (real rock fractures and falls), gear (cliffs are big, please don't bring your gym rope. Learn quickdraw), etiquette (don't blast your music). Also could make a list of must have skills before you go outside (sport anchors, cleaning the route)
Engagement by climbers will be low unless they have the opportunity to learn hard skills, more than just ethics and conservation tips. Gyms will not be able to offer hard skills training due to insurance. Partnerships need to be made with guides to offer "Tech tip" nights or something similar which could include advice and skills from insured guides as well as ethics and conservation info. Guide companies would get to promote their businesses and be seen to be giving back and supporting the OAC, and the gyms wouldn't have to hold the insurance liability.

# Who?
engage with an agency
Guide do a great job of this. 
I'm sure reaching out the climbing community people would volunteer who have graphic design experience and could help make materials.
Reach out to ecologists outside the community to assist
Reach out to people in the community that have a proven track record of getting this stuff done (i.e. Justin Dwyer)
Promote LNT and promote guide organizations that follow established best practices.
Partnerships with the gyms, conservation/parks experts, crag/guidebook experts, media/marketing assistance, editor support.
My partner has a significant amount of outdoor ed experience, and has worked for several s. Ontario conservation authorities. I'll be in touch.
Engage local conservation biologists/ecologists to speak at these courses (if possible...I know that’s a lot of organizational work). Sometimes it can help drive home the message of people hear about conservation issues from a “professional”! Course participants would also gain a greater understanding of how climbers/climbing can impact entire ecosystems (and it might help to hear just how rare some Ontario ecosystems are!)


# Distribution
Find people that can hand out business cards with the information
Make pamphlets. A video.
Part of a clinic?
Spring and fall big events for the start of each season. Monthly or weekly messages/reminders posted on  media as reminders for good behaviour (ex- pack out garbage, no music, etc.)
A video... hand outs are the worst and make more trash
YouTube videos?
YouTube videos and social media
By encourage to give free info, people will be inclined to listen to the program.
active instagram account, youtube, mentoring?
Print mostly no longer useful in our day.  Expand your presence to climbing social media groups. Get gym owners pin board. Possibly organize gym climbing outdoors sessions with good outdoor culture that could also be additional source of revenue.
I would start with MEC, since most people buy their gear there... handing out a pamphlet to everyone buying their first pair of Mad Rocks is a start,
Posters?
Posters and social nights
Posters, informational tables or member presence are ideas
Posters in gyms showing outside climbing edict.
Pretty posters, booths at gyms in the evenings.
Print flyers that gyms could give out as a reminder during their courses?
Pamphlets, classes/info sessions, guided tours
Charge small fee for people to purchase the reading materials. Charge small fee if running any sort of events/open forums.

# Content tips

Work with the provincial ministry and other provinces' access groups to collect materials and leverage only the most informative/accurate/relevant.
Make it fun, make it interesting and show case ways poor environmental habits can have access taken away
Sell “crag bags” with smart crag things - bio toilet paper, trash out bags, coveted OAC hang tag, drive and parking info, etc
Scuba diving open water certification has a good platform. Small private class, lessons and practical once or twice a week. Then an “open water certification test” at a crag with the teacher and volunteer mentors to watch over and help guide.
Focus on how sensitive access is, and that we need to be stewards.
Develop infographics
Educacate people on the cedars and plant life that are fragile and require protection, and the best ways to dispose of human waste and protect our water systems, as well as the negative impacts that climbing has.
I think the access coalition did a good job with some of their movies i also think finding experienced clibers to talk about common first time mistakes a faupas would be benificial
Involve members who are conservationists/biologists/guides/outdoor educators in the development of the materials. Emphasize "no trace" ethics. Provide an incentive to gyms to do this. Financial benefit is obvious. You'd need to train people to deliver the program. It would have to be cost-effective for the gym to send their staff to do that. Or tie in with guiding companies to get their staff involved. It would be great for the guiding companies, because they'd get a lot of free press. And they're out at the cliffs regularly, so they probably are familiar with the worst offences, etc.
Simple print outs with general info on crags, locations, lessons and sessions proceeded by Leslie and similar, and include best practices
Use content that has already been created -- Justin Dwyer's document about species-at-risk for instance
Use statistics or subjective data. Single page format. Maybe stickers or pins that people can understand and find fun

## Content tips: survey
Survey climbers, get knowledge of biggest transition to outdoor issues. Perhaps a quick checklist in the program would be ideal and intuitive.
Survey of climbers for important info when moving from gym to crag. Maybe have gym ambassadors who can be the representative for any questions and best practices too
take information from surveys such as these into account, and present the most pressing needs
Talk to new climbers about what they need in terms of info. Find out the main environmental issues. Talk to existing climbers about what bad habits they see and best practices. Make it pretty with graphics. Print it and put it in all gyms.
Work with local conservation authorities (like Halton conservation, Toronto conservation,  grey Bruce, or even parks canada) who might already have some ideas and information.  


# How
Get social financing,
Reach out to the community to help. I'd offer writing or research skills. There's likely more than one graphic designer out there who needs the professional exposure. Etc.
An "immersive" course which includes both gym instruction sessions and outdoor sessions, with the SAME instructor and cohort present at both.
Get some from the access fund and copy it.
Crowdsource it to the community. This will promote engagement, diversity of thought, and take away the work of creating it ourselves.
Collaborate. Partnerships with conservation organizations but Mae it more modern and flashy and fun and light hearted.
Getting in touch with the Leave no Trace organization. Getting a peace no trace master educator such as myself involved could be good.
Stickers!
Talk to MEC.
Talk to the gyms and the guides? Also, Alpine Club, because it is often the way people start climbing outside. That said, I've seen some pretty scary belaying from noobs outside who learned on grigris in gyms (True North, I'm looking at you), so perhaps especially the gyms, if their insurance policies allow for such courses.
work with conservation authorities to understand their motivations and concerns about outdoor climbing so that their information is also included in the program, identify climbers at each gym where the program is led who are already experienced outdoor climbers and would be willing to mentor gumbies and take them to a crag for a day to show them the ropes.
volunteers
Maybe take donations to that very cause, explaining that you will be presenting materials at local gyms.
Create a standarized framework, and train volunteers (Active outdoor climbers in Ontario) to give these talks. Create incentives for volunteerism with gear or discount rewards (Like free parking passes for Nemo)

# Don't do it
Don't. Stop encouraging the gym to crag conversion.
Stop promoting Gym-to-Crag
Don’t bother
I don’t think it’s your place to get involved. 
I do not think it is the OAC's mission statement to promote outdoor climbing over gym climbing, which is what a more proactive presence in gyms will result in.

# Do it
Do it. 
Just get it done. With a strong leadership and enough dedicated help, it wouldn’t be hard. Just need to be organized

# Unsure
Great idea, but not sure
Great Idea. Not so sure.
I’m unsure. I’m sure more of this material can be helpful for gym to outdoor transitions.
Not sure
Not sure
Not sure.
Not sure.
Not sure...
I don't understand this question? You want to advice on how to develop materials or how to distribute them? 
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure how but I'm definitely supportive of it
Don’t know
I fear encouraging additional climbers to move from the gym to the crag will put the cart far ahead of the horse as climbing is only slowly being accepted (by one conservation authority so far) and tax areas more heavily (regardless of best behaviours). Meeting the climbers at the crag who have already decided to attend will capture those who have made the decision to climb outdoors already without prejudicing anyone who isn't already interested.
This is a confusing question.
Unknown
I suspect you guys are already doing anything I could suggest.

# Misc
I find this issue interesting as the gyms seem reluctant to be involved.
Having the material pushed as part of the program.
Get them off their phones and into nature, people are far to disconnected to make the connection that nature surrounding them is an extension of themselves.  they are convinced that they were born of divinity while nature simply unfolded separately from how they came into being.  Praise nature for what it is, your mother.
I would like to see a gym to crag program offered in the gym, even if it meant a top rope was used for backup to alleviate liability issues.
organize gym to crag trips
It’s hard to answer this without knowing more background information. But this is a project that I would be interested in volunteering to assist with.
I think having people responsible for this in particular is important though.
